You're at the age where you're old enough to make decisions for yourself and your own life and it's not fair of them to paint certain life choices that you make as \"picking them over us\". It's not that situation at all an you shouldn't fall into that trap by having that mentality. \"Should I pick the side of my relationship or the side of my parents?\" Seriously I hate when families do this. You should have the right to make your own decisions and your own mistakes without your family trying to take control or them taking it so personally. Your relationship has nothing to do with them. This isn't a person that they would have to spend their life with so why should they get to dictate the decisionsZ of u pick their \"side\" you'll be unhappy and may grow to resent then once you realize that this pattern won't change. I'm not saying you have to rub it in their face or anything, if you choose to keep it a secret to keep the peace, you are justified because quite frankly it's the only option that will make both parties happy.","You're in University, if they don't approve of you being in a relationship just be firm with them that you're an adult.

A relationship is just a relationship. Perhaps it will end up soon. Your connection with your parents is forever and they will never stop loving you. Relationship is like friendship... they come and go. I would never exchange my family or our values by anyone, especially somebody that barely knows me. Take the right side, pls!

They're very confidential and will refer you to a specialist after seeing if other methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy can work for you. Options are open!","If you simply want to talk about your thoughts there is a website called BigWhiteWall.com . This website is great for posting thoughts and feelings and also getting to know other people who are going through the same thing. They can comment on your post for advice and you can do the same on theirs. It is also confidential!","amen","i love how this confession turned out"],

And that on top of it, you were encountered by hostility from some people. I completely understand. If you were saying yes so hed stop asking, thats rape. If he pressured you, thats rape. If at some points, you wished it would stop, thats rape. If u were so drunk that u dont remember consenting its rape. If you said stop, and he stopped - but after a while continued thats rape.Whether or not he realises or affirms any of this. Whether or not there were points where u \"enjoyed\" it in a physical sense.","@hopeless_nostalgiac_ I agree with you, but if she says ‚Äúyes‚Äù and didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno‚Äù after he wouldn‚Äôt know she wants him to stop short of pushing him away. If both parties are drunk then it becomes a blurred line and it‚Äôs hard to make a solid argument.

And I agree enjoyment doesn‚Äôt not equal consent.","@hollywoodsantiago Exactly broo. üëè","@hopeless_nostalgiac_ @canoftin The comments here seem fine, not sure what tipped you off to a problematic society. Also calling it rape if they think \"no\" at some point in their head is unfair to the other person if it was never communicated to them.","@hopeless_nostalgiac_ thankyou.","The comments telling her to do research and look it up as if she wouldnt have done that when it was already implied she did in the post. And the comment that was like \"oh you told him he raped you but you now hesitate blah blah\" proceeding with insults about her.

As long as you‚Äôre honest with yourself and open to the inevitable evolution of sexuality you can identify as whatever you want. For some, queer is preferable, for others it‚Äôs bisexual heteroromantic, or other combination of words. I don‚Äôt think you should deny your attraction to women though, since bisexuality doesn‚Äôt actually need to mean equal attraction.  TLDR: your attraction is valid, don‚Äôt restrict yourself with labels","I think that bi","you can be bi even if you like girls 10% of the time go live your life","You have a case of internalized biphobia.","Well, maybe ur just queer? Queer is an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities who are not heterosexual or cisgender.","Heteroflexible","@whatjoelthinks best* I'm dumb sorry","That grammar though","Hey, just like whatever you. Don't try to fit yourself in a specific category. Becuase why tf would any want to? Go with the flow and have fun and be comfortable. And if you find the right girl or boy, it doesn't matter what's their gender is. You will probably be with them regardless","@tittyraw  abeg join me to help","Bi bi bi üò©üëåüèº","Being bi is a spectrum so it doesn‚Äôt have to be 50/50 but if you don‚Äôt want to put a label on it you don‚Äôt have to","Maybe you can evaluate your own gender identity? I had 2 friends in same spot as you. One liked manly girls on occasion and the other slept with really drop-dead gorgeous women. Both tried to understand their sexuality but when they tried to focus on their own gender identity. It made a whole lot of sense. The girl who liked really pretty women is trying to go for a sex change into a guy. And the other identifies as woman and she also has lost interest in women but dating a guy that's a bit femme in his ways. It all works out in the end. Be whatever you want and like whoever you want.

The worst thing you could do is ignore problematic signs when they come up and have The situation escalate until no one can do any good about it. At worst, if you told someone about it when it was simply a misunderstanding then at worst you've just embarrassed yourself but then still protected the woman's safety. Practice good observation skills in situations like this so that when the situation arises we can combat this situation eloquently.","@sher_s_ \"turn around bitch I got a use for u\" is his insta bio so im pretty sure ur right","@csimone99 thanks for stalking my bio honeyüòâ","@alimofrad_ verbal rape still don't exist","@sher_s_ üòù oh shit you gon call campus police now?","@alimofrad_ u must be the soyboy who posted this?","@d.santiago2411 would you say this if it were your mother, dumbass","I think its better to be safe.

Low dosages of bc pills are also good and don‚Äôt effect your hormones as much, but only if you‚Äôre pairing with condoms because they do have higher risk of pregnancies","Please reach out to the UofT sexual education centre for any birth control questions! @utsec - they have tons of condoms, information and resources, and new free toys every month!","Taking certain antibiotics will make them ineffective"],

INCEL OFF THE BOW! But in all seriousness, really?","@cam_wit she‚Äôs not gonna see this cam","I think that there is a respectable way for everyone ‚Äì regardless of their gender identity ‚Äì to dress. You could reasonably object to a person walking shirtless into an office, or wearing nothing below the waist (I.e. naked) in a public park. Ultimately, there is an appropriate dress code for public occasions and events (nobody cares about what you do at home) that all people ought to respect ‚Äì especially when sexually provocative cloning is deemed unacceptable. Girls aren‚Äôt excluded from this, but neither are boys or other genders.","*clothing","Dear thots, repent now or you‚Äôll turn 40 and be sitting in an apartment alone, wine drunk watching your friends have children and enjoying their lives while you wonder what happened to your youth","@conal_jarvis another incel telling a incel off.

A lot of us are genuinely nice and we dont want to be associated with dickheads like whoever posted this confession","@conal_jarvis okay","‚ÄúLeftover roast beef‚Äù. Since when was the objectification of women acceptable on this confessions page?","@arjunsingh.1 Chill lol it's not our fault if you feel sexually provoked","@manahyl","@isabeldavissss Sexual attraction and arousal are physiological processes that people do not have control over. They can, however control the way they dress ‚Äì which affects such arousal. Therefore, if we judge the situation by the agency of control - you are responsible for others feeling sexually provoked. By the way, using the collective pronoun ‚Äúour‚Äù is redundant, since this principle applies to everyone ‚Äì men, women and all genders alike. Dress respectably, is the ultimate lesson.","@arjunsingh.1 haha unfortunetly life isn't so black and white . I suggest you find something better to do then nag people on how they dress . On that note I hope you realize that \"dressing respectably \" is extremely grey and what I decide to wear is unfortunetly not society or your choice . But I applaud your attempt to justify sexual arousal because I see shirtless guys all the time and am not sexually aroused yet for some reason a girl can't wear a skimpy dress ? Haha have a nice night sir üò§üò´","@arjunsingh.1 First of all. How people dress is NONE of your business. Second of all. The fact that you even mentioned the idea that ‚Äúdressing respectably‚Äù and if not related it to ‚Äúsexual arousal‚Äù is actually ridiculous. You‚Äôre in 2018 buddy, and I want to let you know that what someone else chooses to wear is not your concern. It‚Äôs actually ridiculous how men...who can be shirtless...are not judged, however when a woman decides to wear a dress that doesn‚Äôt provide ‚Äúfull‚Äù coverage for you, you think it‚Äôs end of the world. Also, just like how you have control over basic things in life such as, waking up, going to school, getting your work done, you also have control over YOUR THOUGHTS, and FEELINGS. They don‚Äôt just magically appear. Everything that we do in the world, has a certain intent to it. Everything has a motive...nothing happens without intention. So, for you to say that ‚Äúpeople get provoked by another‚Äôs clothing‚Äù is something that YOU have to fix by re-evaluating your life. Stop deciding for others what they are and not allowed to wear. God bless whoever made this confession, they seriously need the blessings and a wakeup call in their life.","@isabeldavissss What may be called ‚Äúrespectful clothing‚Äù for an event may be determined by its hosts, more than anything else. That being said, I want to clarify that THIS APPLIES TO ALL GENDERS. Furthermore, your inability to be sexually aroused by clothing doesn‚Äôt preclude others from facing the same ‚Äì which is true for the vast majority of cases. Guys shouldn‚Äôt be shirtless at the wrong place and wrong time, and so shouldn‚Äôt anyone else.","@arjunsingh.1 like I said before why don't you just mind your own business ? Let other people live their lives instead of trolling üò´","@siimmrraanns Please understand that my argument applies to BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. The former do not have the right to be shirtless wherever they want. If I was hosting a party and someone walked in like that, I‚Äôd ask them to leave. Moreover, please don‚Äôt throw around your own pseudo-science. Sexual attraction is a physiological process that we cannot control. This is the truth, and if you don‚Äôt believe it, well ‚ÄúGoogle it‚Äù (‚Äòyou‚Äôre in 2018 buddy‚Äô). What‚Äôs even more ludicrous is that you equate ‚Äúwaking up, going to school and getting your work done‚Äù with mental impulses and feelings. This is the highest of false equivalences. While everything may have an underlying cause, that cause doesn‚Äôt need to be under our control (recall the neural response to stimuli and reflex action you studied in high school biology, if you did). Everything, therefore, may not be consciously premeditated. Finally, please understand that certain rules and conventions do exist for civilized behaviour vis-√†-vis the society you live in. These are increasingly gender neutral, which demolishes your sexism arguments. While you may not like them, perhaps out of a rebellious libertarian and hedonistic youth mentality, that doesn‚Äôt erase them. Disobey they if you must give into urges, but know that you will be given philistine status ‚Äì not even with a hint of righteousness, but merely that of contempt.","@arjunsingh.1 buddy, good luck in life. Mind YOUR OWN business. Stop being concerned with what other people wear or not.","@siimmrraanns If that's your best response to all my arguments, I guess there's little more to be said. Btw, thanks for the good luck. You too! :)","@arjunsingh.1 LOOL buddy, I don‚Äôt want to lose anymore brain cells from arguing with you. So that was your cue to leave. Hold that L btw with having that mentality :)","imagine caring how anyone dresses... guys like this get offended by everything and then make fun of left leaning people for being snowflakes lmao","@siimmrraanns Thank you for your smiles. üòò"],

I remember crying a lot when I saw an F on my transcript. I know it feels like the end of the world when you fail a course but life is so much more than grades. But do remember that you always have an opportunity to take the course again. Think about what went wrong and what you could‚Äôve done differently and that way you can figure out how you‚Äôre going to work harder the next time you take the course. But most of all take care of yourself and don‚Äôt give up. Keep pushing. And if you need to, seek professional help. Best of luck!","@lurvz ü§™ me too. always remember there are many paths to success.

Maybe chem isnt for you","There's so much that life offers which makes ending ones own life not worth it.","Don‚Äôt do that to yourself. Chem is not worth it at all and I understand but killing yourself is never a good option. If you ever need a friend I‚Äôm here and I also took that stupid chem course. Please don‚Äôt do this to yourself over one fail. You won‚Äôt know the amazing taste of success until you fail. So if you ever need to talk I‚Äôm here ok","I've been where you are many times over in my 20 years and I can tell you school feels big and scary and all consuming and painful and that nothing you do matters. It's a terrifying feeling amd hard to see past, sticking around can be the last thing you want to do but you are so much more than this grade, you are all your dreams and ambitions and you matter, every action we take changes the world, hold onto why you went into this program, that will be a light at the end of your tunnel. If you die then the system wins, show them wrong, show them all wrong, show them you can succeed. If at all fails live because you want to see what happens next, live for future you and all you can be.","To whoever wrote this post, please check out the mental health links in the caption if you need to! While not doing well in school is incredibly infuriating, you are so much more than your grades. Ending your life is not the solutionüíõüíõ","Life doesn't end when we fail or fall. Get back up and rethink your options in life, there are literally millions of things out there for you! If you're really determined to get your degree right now, I strongly recommend investing in a tutor in any course you struggle with. Best of luck.","hey there, I failed the lab portion and had to retake the entire course in the winter semester, it was frustrating af and ik that my words may not even amount to anything bc im a stranger but believe me when I say that your life, no matter how shitty u think it is rn, is worth living for!!!! if u have a difficult time reaching out to friends n family, I suggest u come n visit health & wellness (SL 270) and book an appointment w one of the counsellors there! they've been a great help to me so far!! u can also dm me anytime!!! if you need anyone to talk to, I'm here, okay? please hang in there!!!! you matter a whole awful fucking lot. never ever second guess urself for a minute. ever.","Uni comes w/hardships, failure, getting yourself together, working with confidence, & making the best out of these years. So please don‚Äôt kill yourself as this is a time for you to get a hold of everything and do great next semester because nothing is impossible w/out hard work. I‚Äôm here as a friend if u ever need someone to talk to :)","*BREATH* you are more valuable then a stupid course.","@hibakhan_xo dem ones","@ahmeri #relatable"],

Sometimes, talking about it to a stranger helps a lot to get rid of the weight on your shoulders. Once you do so, it'll be easier to talk about your friend to others as well. Reach out to me if you'd like to talk!","I've never experienced a close friend death, I can't give advice about it her,  it I'm sure others here can. My condolences","You will feel so much better when you share this ‚ù§Ô∏è when my dad passed away it took me years to be able to talk about him without breaking down. You're just going to have to and trust that they will be there for you, and I honestly think they will be. I'm sorry for your loss","I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. I‚Äôve been in this situation myself and it‚Äôs terribly difficult having to experience that pain and grief alone.. Of course you don‚Äôt want to put the burden on your friends and stuff, but if they‚Äôre friends they‚Äôll listen and be there for you. Another resource I found helpful is support groups. They exist for this exact reason. You do not have to go through this alone‚ù§Ô∏è again, my condolences, and I hope you find what works for you","I'm so sorry. I truly hope you find people you trust to be able to share this with, it'll really take a lot of the burden away and ease the pain in your heart."],

If you are interested in UTSC I personally work at UTSC admissions and we‚Äôd love to speak with you and give you some guidance if you‚Äôd like :)","You'll make it back. But you will drop out from here again.","I'm sorry but you don't think you have the work ethics to survive uni. Highschool second time around have smartened you up. But it hasn't. I suggest going to college because the way they teach there is truly different from high school and university. Like i left uni for year, well i had Osap issues and they wouldn't let me attend if i paid tuition off. But i had gotten a scholarshipnto Humber. Graduated with honours there. Got 99% LOL. Came back to uni and suffered. Bearly getting 80s and for me it wasn't the work ethic but just the way uni administration is designed. Their policies are literally whack and money was a big issue for me. So don't stress yourself by coming to uni if you can't even deal with high school. You might be an intellect of course but really it means jack shit in uni because you gotta spew out the exact crap that the prof said and wants. You get no freedom and 100% if you critisize the author of whatever fuckall article/book that the prof likes. He will punish you for it because your argument cannot compete against the prof's and the fact he has expertise of the matter. You evidence and proofs will never be strong enough. Anyways i digress but yeah dude I seriously suggest college. You will realize you work ethics might be catered perfectly to you by them."],

I am here to find a career not win the best student award.","@claire_stacey72 doesn't matter *","why is this @absurd_boulder","stressing about your GPA won't make it any higher","Well it‚Äôs all super sujbjective, if you‚Äôre not working towards higher education like a law degree or a doctorate, you can honestly have a great career with ‚Äúgood‚Äù marks (70s 80s). Everyone‚Äôs metric for success is different. I personally am not motivated at all at the thought of achieving a good mark, and spend most of my free time doing side projects or working w clubs/orgs that do the things I love.  Doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt put in the effort for marks, just means at the end of the day I don‚Äôt feel pride putting in the work for them.","@lurvz not every 1st year is me lol","@claire_stacey72 but gps‚Äôs help me when im lost","@mrlukeliu for some reason I feel like I know who wrote this confession..","@_harperchen_ remember what I said the other day lmaooo this guy right tho","@prathit_dave jeez don't let this this guy find u üòÇ","@kunalkasturia LOL what a coincidence üòÇüòÇ","@mrlukeliu sounds weird still","@mrlukeliu oh wait nvm I was reading it wrong LMAO it was just a weird transition","@kris.a1 Lmaooooo I think I transferred my dyslexia to u sorry fam","Gargantuan Painful Agony","@sehelali fr tho üíÄüíÄ","@claire_stacey72 lmao it wasnt me calm down","Im not even at utsc","it's not that it's not important at all, it's that it isn't the most important thing you need in life. if you value GPA over meaningful things and relationships in your life then it's a problem but its important to care about it if you're going to graduate school or something","no","Some people are working hard and still have low gpa. Should they pull their hair out now?","They are meaningless but permanently engraved on your transcript lmao","This guy so insecure about GPAs.","It's meaningless when the person might try to kill themselves just to increase or maintain it. You seem like the type to grade grub and bitch when you don't get that extra 1% mark on your papers. LOL."],

But if you're ever down to try it and the only thing stopping you is fear of addiction, then I would strongly consider that alcohol isn't particularly addictive. People often use it to cope, or don't know how to control their intake which is why they get super drunk. But if you wanted to have a glass of wine when you're at dinner with friends it ain't gonna do any harm. Going to a party and just having one drink and limiting yourself won't \"make you addicted\". I can't tell if you're one of those weird conservative people who think addiction is kids partying and drinking every weekend or if you've actually witnessed people with genuine substance abuse problems. In terms of genuine substance abuse, it's highly unlikely so I would just go for it lol"],

I had a friend who was in love with this guy for years when they were in middle and high school. He would flirt back and say things like ‚Äúwhen we‚Äôre married...‚Äù and then also proceed to see other girls romantically. He strung her along for years before she confessed that she liked him and *silence*. Poor thing, it took her four years to get over it. My advice? Separate your romantic feelings for her from your friendship and let go of the love aspect. If she can‚Äôt respect you enough to respond back to your confession, she isn‚Äôt the one. She‚Äôs using you as a safety net and you‚Äôre better than that.","yoikes bud"],

Im doing one in science and im strongly considering either going into teaching (because I've always enjoyed tutoring people and i seem to be decent at it) or picking up a trade after my degree (because it will be simple af compared to what im doing now and i would still start my career sooner than if i did grad school in either teaching or physics)","Apparently some trades right now are severely under populated. Because everyone wants a university degree. There is nothing wrong with going to trade school. And you will not simply make more money because of a university degree. Most people with a university degree graduate and have zero doors open to them other than more schooling. Tradesmen can start their career day one. If they pick a decent trade.","So if youre a first year student asking yourself whats the point of you going to uni. Ask what is your degree leading to. If its nothing but an over populated field filled to the brim with people doing research on a bunch of nothing topics, just drop out and go to college. Way more practical. If youre near the end of your degree finish then go to college anyways.","Also dont go to teachers college just because you dont want to do research and you cant think of anything else. Thats how we get useless high school teachers.

You aren‚Äôt a burden , life is just taking you through a big roller coaster, take a break but don‚Äôt think this is the only option. I don‚Äôt know you but I believe you aren‚Äôt a burden. Mental illness sucks but don‚Äôt let it control you , you are powerful beyond all measures.","As I always say, you have every right to choose whether or not to keep living, that‚Äôs your prerogative as a human being. But you‚Äôre only in the second year of university, there‚Äôs so much more yet to come and you‚Äôll definitely find friends with whom you can form an intimate connection. The truth is, most ‚Äúfriendships‚Äù are shallow and just a way to pass time. We may not admit it, but we all struggle to form genuine friendships. It‚Äôs much tougher for you because you can‚Äôt sustain the first shallow type ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù. But if you keep going, you will find true and genuine friends. Take it from someone who had basically zero real coherent friendships until high school and spent my time in and out of school counsellors‚Äô offices. Give life a chance, it‚Äôll be tough, but you will pull through and you will be happy.","With everything holding you back you will a beautiful story when you reach a point in your life where you look back to see what you have accomplished despite the odds. Mental illness it something that we can try to overcome as hard as we can but  probably fail because it something that we are so suppose to  tolerate. Something we can only learn how to dial down and work around for life. I can't promise that life gets better because who am I to know but please live. You posted here so I believe you really really do not want to die and you only want to  get through this and I get you and I really want you to live. I don't know how to convince you but if for anything please just live in spite of everything because I really love to hear stories of people who make despite all that hold them back I really need you to be a success story although I'll never know or meet you.","Listen to more bob marley, life is worth more than anything. ‚ù§Ô∏è","And dont worry be happyüëåüèºüå†‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®üî•","Honestly fuck anyone who doesn‚Äôt accept you for who you are. There is someone who will understand you and who will love and care for you even more for that. Find happiness in the little things until you find your person.","Please dont üò¢üò¢üò¢ i can be your friend even through your mood shifts. Give your life a chance; you dont know that youll be feeling like shit forever. Give it the benefit of the doubt. And dm me or we can chat on sarahah (link in bio) if you wanna stay anon","Hey don‚Äôt do that. Imagine how everyone will feel when you‚Äôre gone. I‚Äôm here if you need someone to talk to. Your life is very valuable and precious. Fuck everyone who left you, remember there‚Äôs always someone there who‚Äôs willing to be by your side. Dm me if you wanna talk, I‚Äôm all ears.","If your mental illness is driving people away they‚Äôre not worth having as friends anyway. I‚Äôm free to talk anytime, just dm me","Please message me.","Hey friend! You can't do that you know why? Because you're important! I'm not telling you that because your family needs you or that you have friends or don't have friends it's because you're a miracle of nature and your life is every bit as valuable as everything else living. You go take life by the horns and show that bastard what an amazing piece of miracle you are. If you or anyone else needs a listening ear I'm here but know that your not alive for anyone else but yourself."],

Morning after I wake up, afternoon and night before sleeping. And the most important of all is to smile while meditating. A simple smile can create massive positive vibrations. You can also listen to some hypnotherapy audio on YouTube. Listen to some fun music while you do tasks, like I Feel Good by James Brown üòÇ Also I suggest making a routine for each day of the week.

Eventually I said screw it and stopped wearing long sleeves. They'll be mad at first but will get over it eventually. It's better to do what you want instead of letting your fam make your decisions","@elizabetht003 don‚Äôt you think if u don‚Äôt have a family, you won‚Äôt be where you are right now. Without family you would be in a foster care where there are chances of rape so as kids grow up they run away from there. Get into bad stuff to make easy money, drugs etc. Drugs addiction = Homeless . No study, No phone, No food, No shelter. You would probably be out in today‚Äôs snow storm. Just saying not being rude ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Think about it.","@shahzaibsansi I don't see what any of that has to do with getting tattoos. I can appreciate my family without letting them control every aspect of my life and what I decide to do with my body.","@elizabetht003  you said do what u want instead of letting ur family make decisions for urself. After raising you up. They don‚Äôt even have a right to tell you not to get tattoo?","@shahzaibsansi They have a right to give me their opinion but it shouldn't 100% determine my decision. Just because they're family doesn't mean they get to make me do what they want. You'll never be happy if you let all of your decisions be decided by other people. Whether you share the same DNA or not, at the end of the day only you yourself know what's best to make you happy","@elizabetht003  my parents make all of my decisions, I don‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt waste my time choosing cloths, I don‚Äôt worry about what to eat, I don‚Äôt worry what i have to become in future. I feel like the  happiest person on planet earth, only because my parents make my decisions , they got like x2.5 more experience than me in life. üëåüèªüëåüèª We all are totally dumb ppl trying to act cool n cocky making our own decisions. Acting like parents don‚Äôt know anything. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","@shahzaibsansi lol you sound brainwashed. I'd rather learn through my own mistakes than obey every command I'm given","@elizabetht003  yea!! Then get stressed out, try to kill urself. Listen to shittest music to punish urself üòÇüòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Hate youself. Stress , depression, anxiety. FUCKKK I DONOT EVEN KNOW WHAT DOES MEAN, THANK GOD üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª","@shahzaibsansi wat","You are disgusting.The fact that your justifying your parents having a leash around ur neck and lash out at anyone with more self respect and bravery than you shows ur character as a petty lil shit who can't handle anyone with more balls than themselvesüôå","@elizabetht003 ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I am telling u that this is what happens when u trying to be independent","@shahzaibsansi you can't depend on others forever tho. Eventually we gotta learn to grow up and live our own lives","@elizabetht003  not like that. If u wanna be independent, work urself , leave the house, live on ur own, get as many tatoos as u want . But when you are with them , they are feeding you then obey them","@timothy_cherian bro. Holy shitt!!!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ . This is the longest comment i have ever seen. I am not even reading it. I only red the last line and I totally disagree. The ppl who brought you to existence deserve more than this. Bye","@shahzaibsansi sorry deleted it, ill repost it to make it more readable","@timothy_cherian what did you say?","@timothy_cherian  don‚Äôt bro. Sorry don‚Äôt @. Do whatever you guys want. Fuck ur step mom or get fucked my ur dad. Bye sorry. Have a nice day :)","@shahzaibsansi I know this was long but I'll try and break it down; Firstly people come from different families and not everyone's family is the same so never assume that it's the same as for you as for her. Secondly, all of us at one point in time will have to learn to be independant we can't always expect our parents to do everything for us and we should always be indebted to them. If we live our lives that way then when the time comes for us to have kids, You'll have to experience the same thing maybe because your kids will feel differently about how you feel regarding your parents. You can leave now, but that's because maybe you feel you're too right to even hear what some of us are saying. When you leave that's just ignoring what we all have to say which I hope you won't do to your kids when the time comes for you to have a family and you listen to them and understand their needs in the lives they live.","@shahzaibsansi yeah agreed. I can't argue for long. Can we just end this by saying we disagree but respect each other's opinions all the same?"],

Sorry bud. Maybe let her know before y'all get too attached to each other","I was in this position back in first year, we ended up dating until third year and by that point we'd simply grown apart. I had the same curiosity here and there, my ex would talk about wanting to marry me and whatnot however I felt like I would be missing out if I didn't explore other things. If you have a good thing going, I feel that a week break to go wild could easily cause drama. To me that would lead to more curiosity, which isn't a bad thing, but if you do want this to work out I could see that wrecking things between you.","Everything in a relationship is a choice. Doubts like this are normal to arise when serious commitments feel like they're on the horizon (doubts are a coping mechanism caused by anxieties about the future). But it's up to u to be honest with yourself about what u truly want and what will make u happy. At what age do you want to get married? Say it's 10 years from now. Will you be happy to be with the same person for that length BEFOREHAND marriage and then spend the rest of your life with them? My parents did that and have been married for over 50 years, so it's possible. But times are different and there's nothing wrong with wanting to have more experience. If you feel like you could really be with other people sexually while on a \"break\" with the person you love, maybe your not really love them. Being emotionally available for that kinda thing so soon means you've already emotionally checked out of the relationship. But if u feel like it would hurt u or your partner realistically but you still want to do it, the best way to go is a clean break up where both of u can heal and move on before pursuing other people both emotionally or physically. I went through this during first year and the break up was much better than a \"safe break\" where you're being dragged along as someone's second option.","@oanacalinx curious that i read it as a her ü§î","@kuuqiu ur stoopid okay bobodys gonna listen to ur dumdum word","@nomaderrick ur actually  STUPUD","If your partner feels the same way, I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with the threesome idea","@mrlukeliu s√†me"],

Communists are clearly not liberal and are entirely opposed to liberalism. Even if we're using modern definitions of \"liberal\", that still doesnt make them anything like communists. Modern liberals seek not to abolish capital or institute a classless and stateless society, rather they want to mai tain those structures. There may be some parallels between them like their rhetoric against economic inequality and various socially progressive posistions like Pro-LGBT attitudes. But ultimately both ideologies are diameteically opposed to each other: Modern Liberals (like Clinton, Sanders, Trudeau) all seek to maintain structures that Communists (like Marx, Lenin, Luxembourg) seek to remove.","@noandrelo >\"Even if we're using modern definitions of \"liberal\", that still doesnt make them anything like communists. \" >\"There may be some parallels between them\". Do you not see the contradiction here? Also, I never claimed they were the same or even similar , I only claimed that communism is more closely related to modern day liberalism than modern day conservatism.

Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è and feel free to reach out","Don't keep this to yourself, raise awareness and inform the authorities","You are not alone.

I‚Äôve been there a couple of times and the people there are friendly and nice. There are options out there when you don‚Äôt want to go to cops cuz they can be pretty intimidating.

Stop being a pussy and confront her üôÑ","Absolutely not","How about.. you communicate with each other... like adults... wild","@aysha.ramzan I'm not sure showing nudes to her parents is on the same level as her fucking his best friend.","@justinrandall19 I agree with OP not sharing nudes obviously but how is it wrong for him to have set her up with his best friend? She had a choice didn't she? Or we gonna excuse this cheating slut?","Lmaoooo üòÇüòÇüòÇ","What the fuck are you absolutely fucking retarded? Are you sick in the head? Are you in a relationship with her parents or her im a little confused because I dont know why you would want to communicate with them in the first place. Clearly you aren‚Äôt an adult and still really immature. You two need to talk it out and break up. Yes she cheated, so fucking what? Talk to her, call her out on her shit, cuss her tf out, but dont you DARE go to her parents crying bout her nudes or any of yalls private shit its unnecessary and just straight up stupid. Dont be an immature little bitch ass and ruin her relationship with her parents when she could easily do the same back to you. How would you feel if she went to your parents with your nudes? Huh? You want that? No, you fucking dont. Sit the fuck down and be an adult. Smarten your sick head up because i dont even know why you would think of this shit. You wanna know why I can never bring a boy home? Because my ex did the same shit except - i didn‚Äôt fucking cheat. I just left for school reasons and boom he was at my door spilling the tea that i broke his heart and i took his virginity and i sent him nudes and my parents NEVER EVER forgot that day. So do not go shatter her fucking life out of revenge you sick fuck.","First of all, I understand your upset abt her loyalty but if you had a shred of decency you wouldn‚Äôt share her nudes. Second, CONFRONT HER, tell her that you know abt her and your friend, BUT you also have to tell her abt the fact that YOU devised this whole plan. If she comes to you saying ‚Äòthis is all your fault then‚Äô, rebuttal that with the fact that ‚Äòayo idc if the hottest mf on the planet was in front of me and started flirting with me, ik I‚Äôm with you so I wouldn‚Äôt fuck her‚Äô but she deserves to know that you questioned her loyalty in the first place and hatched that plan","okay but would u want ur parents or family seeing your nudes and sexts? just privatey confront her","Thank you, next","Cuck much? What the heck is this? I understand hating someone for cheating but what sort of elaborate idiocy is this? Grow up mate.","what the actual fuck is wrong with you","Nice copy pasta ;)","@wilhelmmalcolm Becasuse it's still a ridiculous plan to prove what was already evident from the minute she sent him nudes. That the girl was already willing to cheat on him but then he's enabling her behavior but then still wants to claim moral superiority and even on top of that tell her parents because it's the \"right thing to do\" when he helped start (at least that we know of) in the first place. You can't claim to.be the wounded party but set up all the charges to get you shot in the face","@justinrandall19 I agree with you generally on claiming any sort of moral superiority but having dealt with this sort of situation sometimes you're in so deep only one thing will confirm your suspicions. I just still think he has a right to be upset even if he set up the hurtful situation. Conversely, if a woman set up her husband of many years by providing him drinks, letting him get drunk and then soliciting a prostitute to test his loyalty, yes the woman is really trying hard to set the guy up but ultimately the wife has a reason to be upset as the other party made a choice. Regardless sending nudes to her parents is ridiculous. Also, weird best friend OP has not sure if I could chill with a friend even if I told him to fuck my girlfriend","@wilhelmmalcolm Just because you're too deep into a situation doesn't mean you can't think rationally and deserve to be humored on every ridiculous whim you go on to prove or disprove your claims. If I got drunk to prove my ex was cheating on me based off of some rumor, drove over to her house to make sure she was telling the truth, then screamed like a lunatic at her while getting the information I need, everyone would be like this guy needs to be put in a psychiatric hospital. He definetely has the right to be hurt over the suspicions but not the hurtful situation because HE engineered it and then on top of that he didn't talk to her even though that could've been the option all along. Hell telling your friend to call it off the minute she sent him a nude is more than enough to prove his suspicions. Even though you told him to do it, it's suspect as hell that your friend had virtually no regrets about fucking your girlfriend even though she was supposed to be in a committed relationship. This whole thing is compounded by enablers on one side and a lack of confrontation on the other and it needs to stop. The both of you fucked up severely when this happened and need to realize that communication is the most essential part of any relationship. It's not fair to either of you to have to keep going through this charade, so you both need to stop it and talk about what you want.","@wilhelmmalcolm idk what crack youre on but you need to fix up. its not the same level. hes about to shatter her relationship with her parents as revenge like wtf are you sick","Why‚Äôre you concerned about her loyalty after 3 years..?","This is whack","Actually seems like you guys are a perfect match for each other. I'm not sure which one is more immoral and messed up, but you sure have a good competition.","fuck your best friend see what all the fuss is about","Wtf is this lmao","ok cuck","Do it pussy shes a bitch","@alice.kalaczynski he mustve had a good reason/clue as he was so spot on, shit happens","@loganhoohing criticizes for being immature yet 80% of the novel is just pointless flaming","@loganhoohing holy shit triggered much did you have a bad day or smthing üòÇ","@ally_bremer lol yes and i released it into a comment and someone is tryna get me back on that bad mood saying its me but MY SOUL cannot be triggered x2 like not gunna lowe sorry üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§","Fyi, you would violate her right under article 12 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights","ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DO THIS. What she did was absolutely shitty and unfair. What you are thinking of doing is illegal sexual violence.","@rattusmus the only real answer in these comments","@gubbles_sher they hated Jesus because She told them the truth.  Gal. 4:16","Don't get her parents involved. Just ghost her and completely phase her out of your life. If she comes back wonder why, let her know you don't tolerate cheating and that you're done. The best revenge is no explanation and no closure for her after she hurt you. And then moving on with your life and being successful.","@loganhoohing I already said sending nudes would be a dick move to do.

If there are scenes of people being captured, and the ratio of one gender is considerably high since history, how can you see it as NOT a cliche. Of course every media content has its individual context and complexity, but I guess the general idea is this. And there are still plenty more examples of females being objectified in the media aside from those kind of depictions.","It means literally the glorification and the obsession of capturing women as if they're literally an object without any sense of autonomy or understanding of the world. Or being so obsessed with the female body there's not a point in understanding any point about here. Including the damsel in distress cliche which is the biggest offender, including having no understandable personality traits or character development and only exists as a goal. The goal is simply just to have women be seen as equal or having a greater purpose rather than a pretty object in a magazine.","@justinrandall19 That's speaking very generally though, it feels like OP's talking about specific cases","People are blowing this way out of proportion. Think of an example regarding female celebrities and models‚Äìthe majority that are chosen are beautiful and ideally ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. That‚Äôs not to say that that‚Äôs how women are supposed to be.

I have friends who broke up with their shitty bfs/gfs in a civil manner (even tho the bf/gf did not deserve it at all). They were miserable for a long time. But the folks who bitched and cussed and had full out war to end the relationship were happily with another who really deserves them.

The first step can be hard but it is necessary to achieve a better you.","You should speak to someone, you may be attracted to it for the wrong reasons and are caught in a cycle. I know for some women who grew up in toxic or abusive homes (not sure if that's your case ) , they tend to look for similar traits in a partner, not consciously. It's difficult to get out of, but it's good you are aware of this.

You broke up with her so now you need to move on and stop being a lil bitch about.","@whatjoelthinks Trust no one, and you may be pleasantly surprised.","@reb1z Even still it has to reflect a certain type of person to move in from such a relationship that intensively so quickly and without any thought of the implications of how it could affect the friend group. If a guy did the same thing, everyone would have stated what a piece of shit he was everywhere.","@justinrandall19 guys do it all the time tho. He should be glad she didn't throw fit and cling to him. They both agreed to end it because both of them were not feeling thr relationship anymore. So he shouldn't be shocked that she is with another right away. Some people are like that. Some move on after months or even a year, and some literally in days. People will talk shit regardless if you are good guy or a bad guy. No one knows what's the truth. Even the people who are in the said relationship.","@reb1z Then on top of that they didn't even think to consult their friends on how it might change their relationship dynamics or how they might be affected going forward as a friend group. Yes it is true that some people move on quickly after relationships, but days after is a bit much and not without talking through to see if everyone's on board with everything. On top of that you cant place an argument of subjectivity in terms of relationships in saying that no one knows the truth but then suggest the concept of morals later in that \"people will talk shit if you are the good guy or a bad guy.\"","@reb1z Plus no one is saying that guys moving on from relationships quickly is a good thing either.","@justinrandall19 um what world do you live in even ? Lolz these friendship ain't gonna mean shit after grad hahaha. Haha no one I know would have thought about asking the friend how they feel. Hahaha really just don't see why the person is bitter. If she had broken up with him and gone to a friend then maybe i can see why he is upset because he didn't know he would be dumped like that and get snaked by her and his friend. But even then, its better there is break up rather then she cheating on him with his friend. Unless the people are like Middle Eastern or Indian... because there are cultural issues then and conflicts because they can't fully handle adopting western culture, especially the concept of dating and western dating rules. Anyways you should agree to disagree on this matter with me. It's just a stupid anon post lolz.","@reb1z Fine fair enough but she still went to one of his best friends without consulting him just after they broke up. Which still leaves a pretty good reason to be bitter. Just because the impact of something isn't all lasting doesn't mean it can't be damaging during its initial period of impact. Meaning that something traumatizing during one period of your life can still have reverberations during later periods. For example, if you suffered an accident or near death experience as a child but got over your initial fears, it can still have lasting psychological affects on your life and how you conduct yourself. Not to mention that you should be careful with that phrase it's not going to last after undergrad because people excuse tons of fucked up statements with that logic that it's not going to last past undergrad.","@reb1z What? I don't even understand what you're trying to say.","@justinrandall19 i think it is on the so-called best friend the fault for this. She is just an ex now. And some exes can be  worse and more horrid then this lolz. And it's a fact in my experience that nothing lasts more then 3 years in this day an age.","@reb1z Like I said fine fair enough, but still try to have some ideals of s lasting relationship.","@justinrandall19 When you're in uni and if it doesn't work out then its perfectly fine. At least you tried.","@justinrandall19 haha well I'll never know now. I didn't date and I'm graduated. üôèüèº"],

Please reach out to anyone.","I know it‚Äôs hard but it will get better! Please believe!!!","It's not your job to worry about where you will live, let your parents worry about that. Just focus on your grades and your happiness. Life is full of ups and downs, this will pass and things will get better.

I know people will tell you things you already know or things you've already been told. So I'm telling you if you love your siblings, you need to stay alive for them. If you're older, they look up to you and being left behind with abusive parents might make them feel like they've been abandoned by someone they love and trust. If you're younger, they always want to be there to protect you from the harms of the world so go to them and talk to them. See if you could work together to work things out.","Heyyyy! Please don‚Äôt think of ding anything that will create a shock for your parents and siblings as it‚Äôs not correct to put yourself in pain. As others have already said please do your very best and focus on getting those good grades which will lead u to have a great job in the future.

Please don't change. The right girl will come along üòä","Just be yourself and don‚Äôt let your past failures in relationships change who you are. Most likely you just haven‚Äôt met the girl that is mature enough to appreciate your good qualities as a respectful human being. Fuckboys are not attractive at all!","Your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù clearly ain‚Äôt much of a friend.","Absolutely don't go to the dark side. A little bit of nice and a bit of spice can be just what a girl wants. I can't speak on behalf of all girls, but rude does not equal good dude","If that‚Äôs the reason of the break up then you don‚Äôt need to change yourself for anybody. You just ended up being with the wrong partner and friend.","You should be your best self and if someone can‚Äôt appreciate that, then they aren‚Äôt worth your time.

That was on you and how you chose to deal with the pain. Show her how insignificant and unsuccessful she was at breaking you","By remaining kind and gentle^","A lot of times girls expect guys to be douches. When they find someone who's actually a gentleman they think it's just an act. So they fuck things up before they think he can. Stay good man cuz trust me when I say there are girls who DO NOT want a douche bf.","You sound like a really kind person. From what you said she really is not worth your time and her \"reasons\" are completely invalid. Be who you are and don't change because you think that's what girls want. I'll tell you that the real girls that will love you and care about you will want a guy who is kind, honest who is a gentleman etc. The girls that you've unfortunately come across will realize their mistakes one day and they are not your problems anymore.","@hollywoodsantiago 10 bucks you wrote this","Honestly it isn‚Äôt a dichotomy. You can have a perfect mix of both. Be an asshole at the right times and be nice at the right times. It‚Äôs as simple as that.","Find better females clearly ur not the problem the problem is ur selection of them","After having been with dickheads, a can confidently say i dont find it pleasing in the slightest.","My ex got mad at me for wearing mascara asking who im trying to impress since hes not around.

		"comments" : ["Mans trynna find a wife, idk what you‚Äôre saying","Oh don‚Äôt blame it on jocks. In this ‚Äòliberal‚Äô ‚Äòsexually liberated‚Äô world, heartbreak and jealousy naturally run rampant. It‚Äôs part and parcel of our value system. At this point what even is the point of notioms like ‚Äòlove‚Äô, ‚Äòsoulmates‚Äô, and ‚Äòrelationships‚Äô? These relics of the past might as well go the way of the dodo. They‚Äôre absolutely incompatible with our current value system, which places short term individual pleasure above all else. Stop slut-shaming people, regardless of their gender, propensity to play sports or any other fact about them. YOU don‚Äôt get a say in what they do with their bodies. Having sex with them once doesn‚Äôt give you exclusive control of them. Get with the agenda, it‚Äôs 2018.","@armaansahgal yes I agree. The problem lies in this imaginary binary between the ‚Äúfuckboy‚Äù and the ‚Äúcommitted man‚Äù. You see, the ‚Äúfuckboy‚Äù or ‚Äúhoe‚Äù for the female equivalent, having more interest from the opposing gender thus perpetuates more interest in them retroactively. As in, the more women that like a guy or the more men that like a girl, the more people will be romantically interested in them further (as a snowball effect). Thus the individual views them not as something to love but some challenge to conquer, some prize to be won by your unique talent at the loss of everyone else. And then when they fail to do so, largely due to the popular person in question maneuvering the various romantic interests they have based on hedonistic parochial notions of love that you mentioned, both sides are quick to say ‚Äúwow she‚Äôs just a bitch who breaks hearts‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat a hoe she‚Äôs with every guy‚Äù and conversely ‚Äúwow what a fuckboy he‚Äôs just here for sex and to make every girl feel special‚Äù. I mean even this pedestal within which a woman or a man has the opportunity to break the hearts of multiple people at once, is provided by the very people who criticize it because they fetishize the (usual) attraction of these people as something to be conquered. Quite sad that they then blame others for this.","I‚Äôm proud of you @utscbigthonk . as time passes, you‚Äôre becoming a surprisingly wise and eloquent sesquipedalian. üíôüíô","Stop slut shaming these boys","It‚Äôs cuffing season.

You are fully within your right to do so, and if it is what your conscious tells you ‚Äì then do it. People have a tendency to judge others by political beliefs (which speak nothing to the reality of character) and impose their own sense of subjective morality and righteousness on others ‚Äì arrogantly believing themselves to be automatically better than the rest. As liberalism would tell us: plurality of opinion is valuable, and tolerance is of the highest virtue.","@arjunsingh.1 I don't think it's true to state that political beliefs speak nothing to the reality of character. Political beliefs can speak volumes. You can't honestly tell me that knowing someone is on the political far-right DOESN'T give some insight to the person's character. Politics effect how we see the world, and in turn, who we are.","@aruladrian People on the far-right can be kind and considerate people as well. It‚Äôs a sweeping generalization based on media portrayals to think they‚Äôre all just a ‚Äúbasket of deplorables‚Äù.","@aruladrian Moreover, even if we assume that someone‚Äôs political views can give us insight into their personal values, that‚Äôs not exclusive to the right. It applies to the Left as well (which many people would consider ‚Äòbad‚Äô based on their subjective notions of morality). There is no exclusivity to Trump supporters or the right, in this regard.","@arjunsingh.1 Regardless of how kind and considerate a person is, it doesn't change the underlying moral and political compass that guides their thoughts and intentions. I don't care if a neo-nazi or a Klansmen is \"nice\" or \"considerate\" to me. I still don't fuck with them lol.","@arjunsingh.1 But really, with the point that American politics has hit, I don't blame the American left for thinking Trump supporters are fucking idiots and treating them as such. They aren't arrogant for it.","worst confession of them all","Chief this might just not be it","@aruladrian You assume that political and moral compasses are aligned. That‚Äôs not true. Moral compasses are firstly subjective, and cannot be generally correlated to the Bourbon political spectrum (left-right) that we hold. It is highly arrogant and presumptuous to think that your personal moral compass must be imposed on the whole of society ‚Äì especially if you don‚Äôt provide any reasoning to back it up. I‚Äôd also point out that you not choosing to associate with ‚ÄúKlansmen or bro-Nazis‚Äù doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone else. You give no reason why it should, either. If it‚Äôs just a personal opinion, there is nothing else I can do about it ‚Äì except point out the lack of logic and why society can, and in absolute terms - widely does, reject it.","@lenaaklapper Canada is a liberal democratic nations where everyone has the right to express their views freely - even those espousing inequality. Read the constitution.","@arjunsingh.1 respect","@arjunsingh.1 you mean to tell me that society widely rejects the notion of not associating with Nazis? Lol man. Nah.","@aruladrian I‚Äôm talking about your subjective moral compass. That being said, it is difficult to assess whether people may reject  the free speech rights of Nazis. I ask you to quote some statistics, since you‚Äôre contesting it. ‚ÄúAssociating‚Äù with a Nazi (assuming Steve Bannon is one), is very different ‚Äì and I am not arguing for that."],

Saying the negative energy is just transferred may be true but it isn‚Äôt the way you talk someone out of feeling suicidal. When you‚Äôre suicidal it just doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs not that you don‚Äôt care about others, your pain just is too strong and is way stronger than your desire to stay for any reason whatsoever, even if that reason may be for the happiness and health of those around you. I‚Äôm in no way saying suicide is the answer, it isn‚Äôt. But telling people they‚Äôll just hurt everyone never works. It just makes the situation worse.","Yeah,  the number of suicidal posts is alarming","I believe you had good intentions with this post but in reality all it does is make it seem like people who are suicidal are selfish. I‚Äôve been dealing with suicidal thoughts for over 6 years, and im not selfish and it‚Äôs not easy to get over it (if it was I wouldn‚Äôt still be suicidal sometimes). So yeah. Good intentions but wording it to make the people who are suicidal feel guilty and that our feelings aren‚Äôt valid wasn‚Äôt the smartest move.","Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem","instead of making people feel selfish for being suicidal let‚Äôs uplift them to the point where they don‚Äôt have to be :)","it's rly not that easy","Oh shut tf up boy/girl, i stopped reading after the word romanticize, different people live in different circumstances, mind sets, emotions, and i psychological status, dafuq are you babbling about..","This is so true!

Don‚Äôt bash yourself sis!! üíû","@rand_omguyy neuroscientists did plenty of research and concluded that too much porn (much like too much of anything) is not good for the brain. Plenty of psychologists also think it‚Äôs bad for their own reasons","@megan.p_q","@ally_bremer well hippity hoppity my brain is my property. They should mine their own businessss.","@rand_omguyy no one‚Äôs tyna tell u what to do they just wanna put the data out there so that you can make your own informed choices","@ally_bremer Yes but it's hard to quantify how much is too much because the brain reaches different amounts of saturation on different levels of engagement with porn. Plus there are some psychological benefits to watching it in the sense that you can understand what you or your partner might like sexually and it can form a bit if wish fulfillment in a non hazardous environment. However, I do realize your point about some of the negative aspects of porn and the industry that we as a society are continuing to ignore. For example, the fact that many doi not realize many of the scenarios and techniques acted out in porn films are not realistic and that largely the actors have rehearsed all the scenes beforehand and it's not necessarily what you or your partner would want to do in real life. Also, the lives and reputations of many performers are irreparably damaged in the industry and are forced to keep doing porn or stripping for the rest of their lives because they cannot find work elsewhere. Mostly due to their extensive history online. Also, the industry isn't always careful about the spread of STDs in some studios although for the most part they have been improving drastically since the dangerous early days of the 70s. All in all, the negative psychological effects of porn can largely be countered by taking more of an educated look at porn which some U.S. schools and community centers are doing to maintain the image and integrity of women throughout viewership. Caution can have some relevance but in this scenario it is not a guiding principle.","@justinrandall19 amen","@vlad_christian777 Hey not everyone has the mental restraint that you have","@justinrandall19 jeeze nigga u got too much time in yo hands writing an essay comment üòùüòùüòù get a life","@d.santiago2411 Nah man, just like to keep people equally informed.

Her being shut down is democracy in action. Persecution isnt like voldemort, saying it out loud doesn‚Äôt make it appear","@rrpark19 We don't just live in a democracy, but a liberal democracy - where the fundamental liberties of an individual reigns supreme over the will of the people. Speech is one of these. Therefore; regardless of what Faith Goldy says, or whether you agree or disagree, she has a right to say whatever she wishes pursuant to the law (which she has adhered to). To paraphrase George Orwell, liberty \"means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear\" - and there is no right to not be offended.","@rrpark19 She never said that. Idk where you got that from. She was a journalist at that time and it was her footage taken at the ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally that was broadcasted throughout the world. She connected with CNN, Fox and other mainstream medias plus other ones. She was only there broadcasting NOT supporting neo-nazis. The person you‚Äôre calling a ‚Äúneo-nazi‚Äù also believes in the one state solution for Israel and is against the BDS movement. You‚Äôd know that if you weren‚Äôt brainwashed by the leftist media. Both Bell and Rogers silenced her ads and she never got to debate the other candidates. This is democracy?","@nathanjeya98 I got this information from her mouth because I voted in my city‚Äôs mayoral elextion. She was a mayoral candidate, her stance on. Israel, while interesting, means dick in this election. Two things: 1) ‚Äúleftist media‚Äù- i voted for for the PC candidate in the election, and targeted media is also like voldemort, saying it out loud doesnt make it appear. 2) ‚Äú brain washed‚Äù - are you able to articulate ideas without using buzzwords on twitter you edge lord. 3) Democracy is the individual agency to vote and have your representation known. This neo-nazi got 20,000 votes and sadly represents 20,000 Torontonians. That is the actual definition of democracy. Saying ‚Äúthis is democracy?‚Äù is possibly the dumbest thing i‚Äôve read in my life. What is premiss of your question besides being an edge lord and needing friends. Here‚Äôs my question: ‚ÄúDo you think you‚Äôre  an empathetic person? do you have any shred of empathy for other people?‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre from Toronto, but if you aren‚Äôt, we‚Äôd still welcome you and your insane ideas. It‚Äôs the spirit of this place, and you better learn quick.","@rrpark19 also it‚Äôs a meme page, i‚Äôve put way too much effort into this. peace ü§û","@rrpark19 but where did she say? You‚Äôve directly quoted those words. Can you provide me an article or even a video link? Also, you‚Äôre calling 20000 neo nazis? She got groups from all ethnic groups. She was polling 3rd and still wasn‚Äôt given a fair representation in this election. She was shunned out of every opportunity there was to debate. Mainstream media refused to play her ads. I‚Äôll ask again. This is democracy? Where just because your opinion isn‚Äôt liked, you don‚Äôt deserve to be heard? Have we become this intolerant as a society to a point at which we are blinded of the violation of freedom of speech? It‚Äôs disgusting and frankly, it scares me.","Faith Goldy probably has the right to say what she wants. Other people are allowed to say that she's a piece of shit and her platform makes her a shit human being.","If anyone who's so worried about the speech of out-and-out racists and bigots was concerned anywhere as much about the speech of marginalized people, who are systematically silenced by these bigots y'all can't help but protect, we'd be living in a better world.","@nathanjeya98 lol supporting an apartheid is anti-democracy hun","@amariitiamo but she‚Äôs not an apartheid. What do you have to support your claim?","People who‚Äôre saying she‚Äôs a neo-nazi and a racist better do their research. She was a journalist when she attended the ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally. It was her footage that was used all around the globe including CNN, FOX and other mainstream medias and others. She only broadcasted neo nazis, she NEVER supported them. People say she‚Äôs a racist because she said the ‚Äú14 words‚Äù. But what‚Äôs wrong with it? If you replace white with black, asian, brown or any other ethnic groups/race, there would be no problem. What‚Äôs wrong with white people saying? Also she was a journalist merely conducting a thought experiment. She also supports the one state solution for Israel and is against the BDS movement. She‚Äôs not a frickin‚Äô neo nazi."],

I'm in my 1st year, and though sometimes it's challenging academically, I've made some amazing friends and joined some clubs which help balance studying. Though I'm not in ECE, I think that if you take time for your mental health, and surround yourself with people who support you @aigooanda @a.reli.f @mehrr123 @barbara_hellinaras @katieminacs (and vice versa) any path of study can be attainable. Good luck with your uni applications :)","not worth","It's definitely not worth it to come here. I'm in second year and the only thing keeping me going are my friends and family. It is a very stressful university environment with poor mental health services. Many very good students who work very hard still only get mediocre to average marks, and there are definitely courses that are taught or coordinated poorly. Many classes have a huge cohort of students (hundreds to over a thousand in one lecture hall). There are also many issues with this institution. It would definitely be better to attend a different university, go to a college or enter the trades as an apprentice (earn double the money in half the time). I certainly regret coming here. You can take this with a grain of salt, however it's just my honest belief, and what I have observed from many fellow students. I believe you should be happy, be healthy, and thrive during your years of post-secondary education or work, and enjoy what you are doing (genuinely interested in the content, feel that you are doing something meaningful in your life, and for others). Take care, and hope this helps with getting another perspective as you make your decision.","@abdurrafay21000 ya but you‚Äôre paying for a degree not depression...","Worth it.

Nobody cares, thats the hard truth","@robbykoii It depends on who you mean by that. Do you mean that nobody in your immediate circle cares? Or do you mean that in general nobody cares at all for the well being of others. Because we all know that's simply not the case. Almost everyone can relate to stories of people doing something for the common good of all. Plus we all like to help each other out as much as possible when we see people suffering. People are more generous than you think and pretty much everyone can be understood when they're willing to try. Maybe you've just had some bad experiences with someone else and for that I'm truly sorry. But find someone that generally cares about you and your problems. It's the only way to survive."],

Your relationship with your god(s) is your business, their relationship with their god(s) is their business.","@armaansahgal pretty sure you dont know islam","@mikesaad99 Pretty sure you don‚Äôt know the precise beliefs of the person who made the confession but sure, go off.","I‚Äôm Muslim and lean more towards girls, it‚Äôs terrifying I‚Äôll admit, but we can push through it üíû","@armaansahgal just saying if hes a muslim and he follows it he would know","@mikesaad99 1) You‚Äôre assuming it‚Äôs a ‚Äúhe‚Äù, ok... 2) Let them practise their religion how they want to. Just because you interpret it one way, doesn‚Äôt mean they have to. Religion is about faith, and faith is something that is fundamentally personal. You have no right to dictate other people‚Äôs faith, even if you belong to the same religion. So sod off and let them be.","@armaansahgal following a religion means following its rules. following whatever you think is right is not called following a religion","@mikesaad99 Again, stop trying to impose yourself on other people‚Äôs relationships with their god. Not any of your business.","@armaansahgal following a religion means following its rules. following whatever you think is right is not called following a religion","@armaansahgal yeah he can whatever he want didnt say not to","@mikesaad99 Actually you did. You quite literally did. But sure, deny deny deny.","@armaansahgal i said its haram and never said dont learn to read","@mikesaad99 And why on Earth would you say any of that? Oh right, to criticise this individual for not practising their faith the same way you do. I love your logical fallacies though.","Live it uppppppppppppppüëÖ","@armaansahgal why cant i say its haram? also if you know even the slightest about islam you‚Äôd understand that its the right thing to do to tell him that and hope he stays on the right track. but you are ignorant and know nothing about religions or islam (so you dont start saying ‚Äúdid you assumeO.o‚Äù) and what they should follow. so if i want to tell him its haram i can tell him and you have no right to tell me not to if i didnt force him into anything.","@armaansahgal also look at the comments and youd find that im not the only person who mentioned it. have a good night","@mikesaad99 1) Nice ad hominem attacks, another GREAT logical fallacy. 2) ‚ÄúThe right track‚Äù as you see it has nothing to do with the right track as he OR she sees it. You‚Äôre literally doing exactly what I said: Imposing YOUR relationship with god upon others, without understanding the fact that their faith is their business and their business alone.","@armaansahgal Okay ‚Äú making him FOLLOW WHAT ISLAM SAYS‚Äù","@armaansahgal well in islam it says i have to atleast maybe try to help them if i can. go talk to the other guys who mentioned haram or halal and see their POV","@armaansahgal I see where you‚Äôre coming from but there‚Äôs a distinct line drawn between what is being determined as sinful and permissible in Islam. The sin associated with homosexual acts is not suggested with implicit reference as it is explicitly referred to in the Quran. i.e. it‚Äôs not up for interpretation of the believer. This case is also not subject to the false dilemma (just wanted to plug in a logical fallacy since you frequently do that). This is due to the discontinuous nature of sexual acts: you‚Äôre either performing it or you‚Äôre not and thus you are sinning or you are not. However, there is something I‚Äôd like to share to all the LGBT Muslims out there. Being innately born with an attraction to the same sex does not mean you‚Äôre a sinful creation, matter of fact it‚Äôs okay to be gay or lesbian as long as you don‚Äôt act on those attractions. This is in fact your form of Jihad (internal struggle aimed at pleasing Allah). So do take in mind that being bi is totally permissible. Once you involve yourself in a sexual act though, that becomes sinful. Overall, if you interpret homosexual acts as permissible then you‚Äôre rejecting a clear rule associated with Islam, and thus your relationship with god wouldn‚Äôt be classified as one governed by the religion of Islam. Yes your relationship with god is unique to yourself, but your interpretation of the guidelines of Islam should be in concordance with the Quran.","@jad_sibai yeah i totally agree with you that its the acts that count as sinful. being Bi with out doing the sexual acts with the same gender isnt a sinful thing its just that you have to work on it so it doesnt become an actual problem cuz its a hard thing to control.","Aii imma admit it. Lotta niggas been asking and wanna know.....truth is......I‚Äôm bisexual!"],

With that being said, one of the biggest causes of suicide is the fact that the victim doesn‚Äôt feel any type of social solidarity to his or her society and feels as if they are a burden therefore they resort to taking their life thinking it‚Äôll be better for everyone, it‚Äôs not due to selfishness if anything it mostly stems from a very selfless place.","Who‚Äôs clay Jensen ass wrote this tho?","@__shas__ I LOVEEBENEBEWBEHEBEBBWW.

I‚Äôve seen enough cases of martyrdom and it is ridiculous. Granted, there are genuinely mentally afflicted individuals who will perceive everything around them to be negative and will take their lives. That is a different case. That requires heavy amounts of rehabilitation and sometimes can never be fixed. But there are others with little survivability and thus seek a glorified escape through martyrdom. It isn‚Äôt a positive way to gain attention, but it is an effective way. Sort yourself out or seek help. An easy life isn‚Äôt an expectation, it is something you can strive for.","@su_g_q when the rational part of me agrees with the post but the depressed suicidal me is like ‚Äúyah true but weird flex‚Äù","@omar_hassan1535 you‚Äôre entitled to your opinion but i‚Äôll also have you know that means you‚Äôre entitled to also being a wrong, absolute piece of shit. i apologize that the suicidal thoughts and tendencies of those suffering from depression inconvenience you and your worldview. i genuinely do hope you or a loved one never has to suffer through something like this for you to understand the complexity of the situation, which clearly you currently do not comprehend seeing as you believe people off themselves for an easy out to achieve martyrdom. ps babes martyrdom is achieved through sacrifice, not killing yourself because you genuinely do not believe you have any other option. regardless, to each their own i guess.","@rubyy.amin couldnt have said it better üëÄ","@rubyy.amin lol ok aggressive twat. Never said it inconveniences me that anyone is suicidal. It is hardly an inconvenience. Great of you to not read properly and assume as such. Suicide is a matter that has affected my life and I have watched it take its toll. I am advocating for strength under stress. For some reason you decided that I have a hatred for suicidal people and feel a need to belittle them. To that point I question how much you cared to read. Granted it may have also been a lack of perception due to some ideological category which you want to fit me in. Regarding the martyrdom, I had a friend attempt suicide as a way of bringing attention to her cause of suffering in the hopes that it would be properly be dealt with. Don‚Äôt assume your pretentious attitude equates to legitimacy or an education. Also, don‚Äôt call me ‚Äúbabes‚Äù it is creepy and unwarranted. Try and act like a decent human being before spouting garbage. I agree with the statement strongly in the sense that we can‚Äôt bring attention to someone once they are suicidal, it has to be a constant care because this radicalization in result will cause greater numbers of suicides in the name of grabbing care and attention. You‚Äôre horrid and aggressively judgmental. Quite the disgusting trait for someone acting as a social advocate.","@omar_hassan1535 listen yh i can see where you‚Äôre coming from upon your new addition and explanation, but your original comment did not come across similar, quite honestly it sounded condescending et co hence my aggressive response. i apologize for what you have been through, and for my tone","Suicidal behaviour/ideation is a mental illness, no one CHOOSES to be suicidal. Ofc romanticizing it is fucking stupid and needs to stop but you've clearly never been depressed so you don't understand that suicidal people believe they are a burden and that the best thing they can do IS kill themselves. They think they are selfish for continuing to live as a burden. A depressive lense makes it seem like suicide is a noble sacrifice. Also the tone of this is post overall is angry and almost feels like its blaming suicidal people for not trying \"hard enough\". Some people are trying everyday but that doesn't mean they are automatically cured so fuck outta here with that shit- its not gunna convince anyone."],

I personally didn‚Äôt know the guy too well (I basically only knew who he was cause he dated someone who went to my elementary school), and while I was obviously sad to hear he died, not knowing him that well, it didn‚Äôt hit me as hard as it could‚Äôve. I know people who played sports with him & family members who were so sad when it happened, some still haven‚Äôt gotten over it. One guy told me, and I‚Äôm doing my best to quote him here ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to get over.‚Äù I think you need to get help to imp over your mental health friend, so you can get out of this dark place you‚Äôre in.

When two men congregate after a lifetime of separation they are held together only by the string of disappointments time brings, United only in their exasperation at its absurdity. Perhaps suicide is the way; life is only one repose between nothingness and the next. Just logically then, consider your next actions based on this utility standpoint."],

All the fucking ‚Äúmental health resources‚Äù and half-arsed comments from strangers on the internet aren‚Äôt a substitute for good old fashioned friendships and relationships with people who empathise with you just like you do for them. And that‚Äôs hard as shit to deal with especially these days when relationships are as shallow aa a child‚Äôs pool and as fake as the ‚Äúnews‚Äù CNN reports. But don‚Äôt give up. It hurts and sometimes just jumping of the CN tower or in front of a GO bus feels like the best way out. But the best christmas gift you can give yourself is rising above the toxicity of modern society and learning to love and comfort yourself. Definitely what I‚Äôm getting myself for christmas.","Hey buddy, seems like you got a lot to get off your chest. If you need someone to talk to, my DMs are open","Ok but you‚Äôve got to understand that the world does not evolve around you. If they‚Äôre your friends and they‚Äôre the right people you should be with then they give a lot of fks about you. But depending on what kind of person you are when you‚Äôre feeling down or depressed can be a big factor in how they would act around you. They‚Äôre allowed to have enough of your shit and decide they need space to chill off if they‚Äôre finding you too much to handle if you aren‚Äôt actively seeking help. Which going to them isn‚Äôt always the best option. This sounds cold hearted as fk but if they aren‚Äôt going to help with your problem then you gotta try getting yourself out of this. I‚Äôve been there many people have been there and it isn‚Äôt always the best option to sit around and waiting for a few specific people to come to your rescue. Getting out of downs can be simple as fk or it could need hundreds of factors you‚Äôll eventually figure it out. I‚Äôm living now I‚Äôm happy now so chill the fk out and go enjoy life.","honest to god some of the best advice i‚Äôve ever gotten was from complete strangers, they really say the shit you need to hear cause they have no ties to ur shit at all. but you know, to each their own, take care of yourself and keep pushing through.","Therapists are trained to help you, yes they're paid for it (everyone needs to make a living somehow) but they are often genuine and really care about their clients. They also walk you through issues in such a way that lets you see things in a different way, they give you alternate perspectives and help you come up with solutions, and that's important when you feel stuck in an emotion/ situation/ trauma. Don't bash it until you've given it a try. Also finding the right therapist may take time so meet with a few to get a feel for their vibes","My DMs are open if you want to talk about it","I‚Äôve been here too, and the honest best thing that you can do for yourself is take care or yourself. If people aren‚Äôt going to care about you and your situation, you gotta be your own support system. Believe in yourself and your own strength, and your ability to get better.","Stop relying on others and dig yourself out of this hole. Harsh as it sounds you won‚Äôt get better unless you stop pitying yourself and your situation and start actively trying to improve your mindset."],

Sometimes there's no issue with the relationship rather the guy just is dealing with stuff his own way which may include being distant or stressed. That's not to say that's healthy for a relationship but it's a factor to consider. Definitely try having some honest open conversations with him and see where that goes.","Vajazzaling","Best advice. Don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry‚Äù and then when asked what you wanna eat... say ‚Äúidk‚Äù","Definitely talk to him about it first. Tell him you're concerned and that you feel like something is off and that you figure it's just school stress but you're worried it might be something else or that it might be you. Remind him that you are partners and that you're here to help. Him icing you out or \"dealing with things on his own\" isn't fair to you if you're completely in the dark. (Don't make it about yourself though). Listen to what he has to say and if it's just stress or something like that, then plan something nice for him and be a little bit more attentive. Every guys is different, but if he likes physical affection, offer a massage or something. If he's more reserved and likes words, make him a card, write him a letter out of the blue, or send him a random text here and there about how much you care for him. Make him dinner or plan a nice date! Just figure out what his \"Love Language\" is and spend more time trying to let him know that he's cared for.","Sex helps too lol","Communication is Major üîë.

So we've had this question come up on reddit as well, so i'm basically copy/pasting our answer for insta.  ASSU have brought this up with the Dean and FAS so many times. The issues faculty usually raise are largely around profs having to deal with disengaged students near the end of courses and the hypothetical situation of students just not showing up for the final exam/paper because they can pass without it. Obv both excuses are missing the point, but that's usually what happens when we call out faculty. ASSU are currently trying to push for an extension of the deadline, and we're also calling on faculty to release statistics around the % of CR/NCRs used in breadth courses.  We meet with the Dean usually monthly, so be sure to follow us on facebook for updates!! Hope this helps, and good luck with the rest of first year!","LMAO HANS CLASS","dw his exams are chill","@jbowman71 thanks for the update!

It was your brother entirely that destroyed you in such a way. I really hope you should go to the psychiatrist and work through all your pain and move on from such a fundamentally evil family member. You should report it and get him prosecuted hopefully. But more importantly, his sexuality has nothing to do with your abuse. You are a fundamentally good person and was abused by an older sibling. You deserve time to heal and be able to have a happy life outside of wounding and trauma. Get help today and never feel too ugly, unhelpful, or unwanted again in your life. Be you, and only you. For you are the best thing that you can be.","There is a documentary on Netflix \"I am no your Guru by Tony Robinson\" a girl went through something similar and he says it best. I was drowning in my own tears watching it.  Please watch it and DM if you need someone to talk to. You are worthy of love. I love you.","My heart goes out to you. No one deserves to experience that. I want you to know that I and so many other members of the uoft (and UC!!) community are here for you. Don‚Äôt hesitate to message me if you need someone to talk to or lean on ‚ù§Ô∏è","Im so sorry this happened to you. None of it was your fault nor are you the reason for your brother's sexual preference. I hope you've taken time to heal and speak to counselors, trauma can affect us in ways we do not expect.

Bdsm is not a license to hurt or maim people without their consent during sex, it is simply meant to be a way to spice up your sex life if you BOTH are willing to do it. In addition, most couples that do practice it often have a safe phrase or action to indicate that they are uncomfortable with a certain direction which the activity is going. Also, just because you orgasmed doesn't mean consent because thousands of other rape cases have had people who have orgasmed just as a survival instinct just for the people that dissociate the entire experience and leave their bodies. It's simply just a way to process the trauma and pain that's happening, nothing more, nothing less. You should probably call campus police and get a rape kit done if you want to move forward with prosecution. Your choice was robbed of you once, you might get it back again if you go to the police.","@pragathykrishnan not the problem. if there was no code or safeword involved then stop means stop. no excuses."],

In my opinion I think you‚Äôre stressing out so much about this, because you‚Äôre thinking so much about it. Try thinking, ‚Äúfuck it, if I get in great! If I don‚Äôt also great!‚Äù. Put all your effort in but don‚Äôt let it jeopardize your mental health. Good luck to you, and keep your chin up! :D","If this is your stress reaction for applying.

Like many have said, they‚Äôll get you in for the money, but staying in is hard. I often regret coming to uni in general without taking care of my mental health first because it‚Äôs been so close to killing me. Your health will always be more important, take care of that before committing to the true struggle.","If applications are already stressing you out don‚Äôt come here cuz you‚Äôre not gonna make it","Dw I didn't do well on finals at all and my previous stats got me in so just focus on your overall success and person/forget about everything else and just apply to see where it takes you","It‚Äôs not that serious lmaoo","Okay but first please let your friends out of wherever you have locked them"],

		"comments" : ["No idea what dafuq sort of logic they‚Äôre using in Ireland. They literally went from ‚Äúshe had sexy underwear‚Äù to ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok to rape her‚Äù. What even are logic and human rights anymore?","speaking pure facts üò§üò§ no matter what anyone is wearing , that is NOT consent to rape them. If im wearing a lacy thong that doesn‚Äôt give you permission to grope me. If a guy is wearing tight pants that doesnt give you permission to touch his dick. Yo, asking for CONSENT is the most important thing. And if halfway through the person doesnt wanna do it anymore hop the fuck off because that means your consent is gone. Nowadays people dont understand the concept of consent. *What the person is wearing is not consent.* Also if the person is too intoxicated or is not of stable mind to give proper consent then I suggest you wait for another time because their judgement is clouded and it‚Äôs just not a good time. So, stay safe and if you ask someone if it‚Äôs ok and they say yes its okay then you can gwan. If they say no, go away. if you don‚Äôt understand and need a video reference to explain it even BETTER search up Tea Consent on youtube and show it to all your friends. THANKS SENDING THOTS AND PRAYERS ‚ù§Ô∏è","@loganhoohing also nobody is ever asking to get raped. so dont even try that foolishness. look at my costume for halloween (you can literally go look). it was very lacy and extremely exposing - i wasn‚Äôt asking for sex, i was just wearing something i found extremely sexy that i liked. SO WHOEVER THINKS THAT WEARING SEXY SHIT IS ASKING TO GET RAPED - pls tell me so i can box you in your throat","@mikesaad99 pardon the fuck me? Yo what the actual fuck are you dumb? IT IS NOT WHAT IT IS, ITS WHAT MEN MAKE IT. Youre fucking insane. i cant even get words out because im discombobulated that you would even allow yourself to think that way that WE- FEMALES should stop wearing thongs so that we dont get raped yo someone stop me from boxing this kid","@mikesaad99 sit your entitled misogynistic RAPIST ass down. most girls wear thongs so there‚Äôs no visible panty line, not to ‚Äúarouse‚Äù men. regardless, if y‚Äôall gettin aroused enough to rape someshit, idk how y‚Äôall walkin around blaming the girls‚Äô clothing choices instead of uhhhhh, ur fucking inability of self control and not being a walking talking piece of shit.","@mikesaad99 are you retarded","@trash_spider he really is","@mikesaad99 why tf would you even say that. Like if I wear a lace thong or any kind of thong for that matter, I‚Äôm wearing it to make  myself feel great not to arouse stupid guys like you who think we are ‚Äúasking for it‚Äù like shut up and keep your fucking mouth closed","@mikesaad99 Ok so im gunna wear a thong, fishnets and a bra to school. Lets see how many people want to rape me then. Im not changing shit about myself its the mans who need to change themselves. Im not gunna avoid shit im going to hit it head fucking on.","@mikesaad99 since when does what a woman wears define whether they consent??? makes no sense. why would you expect a woman to change what they wear to avoid a rapist?? regardless of what you wear, a rapist is still a rapist. it's not the women who should be expected to change because of something illegal someone is doing.","Didn't the jury in Ireland have 4 women as jurors? Are you telling me 4 women heard the underwear evidence and based solely on that they found the man not guilty?"],

I don‚Äôt want to be the bearer of bad news, but UofT has strict rules about dishing out bonus marks, even if you‚Äôre one percent away from passing. Each student in the course has to have access to every mark opportunity. If they give you a bonus, everyone has to get a bonus. If you end up failing, I‚Äôd suggest possibly submitting a regrade request for your exam, but you do have to pay for these. If you end up contacting your professors, they‚Äôre going to give you the same copy-paste policy. Sorry to hear about the death though, my condolences."],

In addition to that, it all depends on the amount of anxiety or relaxedness you have about having sex for the first time. If you're extremely nervous, chances are the penetration is quite painful and often leaves bad memories or thoughts about sex later on versus being quite relaxed can usually lead to less pain or discomfort. In some cases even your hymen can grow back after breaking so it's not even a seal, it's just something that exists in most women.","@justinrandall19 we love quality education üëåüèΩ","As long as you‚Äôre relaxed and take time to get yourself in the mood you should be fine.

They should be telling kids its okay if you feel like you are the other gender and if you are willing to endure a lot of hardship, you can be the other gender.","@jashanmavi96 Yeah I don't disagree. It's just that OP's experience seems to be with a teacher that's saying less of what you're saying and more of the \"you could be ___ if you wanted to\" which is misleading and confusing if you're a kid hearing it.","@umipiggy agreed. Perfect wording","@lurvz it does confuse people if they are taught extremely generally and not explained properly, which was the point of this post","@asapaddy but its important to explain it properly as its a deep and complicated subject. You dont wanna confuse the 99 other kids by giving an extremely broad and generalized statement like the teacher did in this post.","@owenhu99 okay but nobody is just chosing to be trans because they learned about it. And even if someone did just chose to be trans, why would it matter to you, what impact would this have on your life? And sorry if im getting this wrong from what you said, but why would we tell kids that theyre going to have to experience tons of hardship just to be who they sre of theyre trans? Isnt the point of teaching and informing kids and adults and making our society more inclusive so that way people dont have to suffer or to through hardship just to be recognized as who they really are?","@liv_loves_books 1. Why would it matter to me? Because I care about other people finding their true self? 2. Why should we be telling everyone everything is gonna be easy? Its not. Coming out as trans is NOT easy. Life is NOT easy. Anything in life with significant meaning requires hardship. And we should be teaching young people to accept that and be happy with that.","@owenhu99 idk maybe it was but i have a feeling that it‚Äôs not really about how the concept was explained... maybe that‚Äôs just me tho ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø","@joditab peep the ignorance","@owenhu99 1.Maybe just let people explore their identity, whether they discover if they are or arent trans, and be who they are? How are you going to judge if someone is not being their true self. 2. Sorry my wording wasnt the best before. You are correct, it is hard for people when they come out as trans. They have to jump through legal hoops to be recognized as who they are, they cant pee in public in most places without fear of harassment or assault, are constantly the victims of hate crimes especially poc trans women, thats not even touching on if they have an accepting family and community. So yeah, it can be extremely hard to come out as trans. What i was trying to say, is that as a society we are hopefully progressing further, and it will become easier and easier for people to just be who they are. Do i think that this means everyone that has a difficult life should just shut up, accept it, and be happy about it? No, not so much. If we become compliant with the aspects of society that makes people's lives unnecessarily hard and difficult, then we can never expect anything to change for the better.","@actualghosthunter see no. Arguments like this make it worse. Suicide rate among the transgender community is extremely high 41% at least attempt suicide once in their lifetime and 5% actually do succeed. This is comparable to war-time prisoner levels (or jews in nazi germany) and please lets not pretend like transgender people get treated like people who suffered in those times. One of the many reasons the suicide rate is so high is that people keep on pushing things like \"yes gender is a choice! Hurray\" and then make the younger generation do things that they might regret later on because of the social stigma. Just because it feels right doesn't make it right. Also the argument didn't start because transgender people exist, for all I care they can do whatever the hell they want. But they (or a teacher for that matter) shouldn't enforce opinions like this to children, that is a HUGE problem and I would have it go as far as firing the teacher from the school. Gender isn't a choice, however you can act like a boy if you want to no one cares. But gender is biological.","@liv_loves_books but i was saying that people should accept the difficulties in life and overcome them not to do nothing about them. Thats why i said teachers should teach children that it would be difficult to come out as trans and to do so if they are willing to take on the hardship.","@sinbadthesnowet that‚Äôs not true. As part of Canada we have what is called ‚Äúfreedom of expression‚Äù which does not cover the entirety of speech. The government is allowed to limit our expression which has been done by creating hate speech laws.","@ilgazdemirci99 oof I don‚Äôt even have the energy to correct all the bullshit you just spit üòÇüíÄ ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what transgenders do‚Äù ‚Äúact like a boy if you want to, no one cares‚Äù *goes on about how gender isn‚Äôt a choice and  all the other close-minded, transphobic opinions*","@actualghosthunter lol those are not opinions*. The first ones are statistics from the European physiatric journal and the rest is centuries of biological research. But hey \"close-minded\". Also please don't try to correct highly specialized mathematicians and scientists.","@ilgazdemirci99 I can‚Äôt handle this üòÇüíÄ okay bud","@ilgazdemirci99 it‚Äôs not being enforced on anyone? Literally all that happened is someone told a kid hey you could be a boy if that‚Äôs what you want. Most of the time, they‚Äôre probably gunna remain comfortable with their current gender. But on the chance that later they no longer identify with such given gender, they know that it is something they have a choice on","@actualghosthunter yes enforce might be exaggerated but here's an example: when Caitlyn Jenner was awarded the \"courage award\" by the espy awards, the people in the shortlist that didn't get the award consisted of many people who fought for their respective countries. There was a soldier who was an amputee. He lost his leg and his arm during the iraq war (he wasn't the runner up btw the media overhyped it). Do you really think what caitlyn jenner did was more courageous than someone who fought for his country and almost died, or are we trying to push something to peoples' faces to raise awareness, which I understand why but maybe we're overdoing it just a bit and polarizing people who are for raising awareness for this and for people who disagree for different reasons?","@actualghosthunter Like I understand the teachers thought process, but kids can learn about this when they grow up. They don't have to get thrown into a topic like this by their teachers when it affects less than 0.3% of the global population. Yes by no means is it a small issue but maybe we don't need 5th graders having to talk about this before they learn basic algebra?","@ilgazdemirci99 I think that somewhat early exposure to these sorts of social topics is important for acceptance and tolerance. How and what kids are taught is important. The exposure and conversation around such things is crucial to become comfortable with them and develop that acceptance and awareness.","And then everybody clapped","@simoneeelue üôÑ","PREACH üëè","@actualghosthunter that‚Äôs the thing, we can‚Äôt just assume she‚Äôs unhappy","@actualghosthunter there‚Äôs other ways to be happy and it doesn‚Äôt have to always resort to changing urself","@jasmine.z85 nobody is assuming she‚Äôs unhappy. Like I said to whoever tf the guy is up there. It‚Äôs likely they would remain comfortable with their current gender. But on the chance that later they no longer identify with such given gender, they know that it‚Äôs something they have a choice on. Nobody‚Äôs assuming anything or forcing anything on anyone. Just simply informing them of their options ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","@ok.lets.be.honest free speech includes hate speech. Hate speech is highly subjective and pretty much anything can be considered hate speech if it offends just one person","@livon_maz that is true. In the United States of America so long as your speech does not incite or directly call for violence (such as yelling fire in a crowded theater when there is none) it is essentially protected under the first amendment. In Canada however we do not have the first amendment or free speech and have to deal with the issue of ‚ÄúHate Speech‚Äù which is basically so loosely defined that you are right, charges are filed for simple things such as the improper use of a pronoun. I honestly believe that so long as it does not directly incite or call for violence, you should have the right to say whatever you want. It doesn‚Äôt mean I think saying racist, transphobic, homophobic, etc. things are okay by any means but I believe we should have the right to speak freely.","@willowemilyy yet here you are leaving a comment on something you don‚Äôt agree with","@livon_maz @ok.lets.be.honest did we just have a civil discussion??? üëèüèΩüëèüèΩ"],

Ask yourself what really would make you happy and what gives your life meaning. Or distract your mind with hobbies or healthy activities. Maybe gain a good sense of individuality and learn to love yourself first. If you feel like your mind is playing tricks on you then definitely seek medical help. I don‚Äôt know you enough from this post to give you good advice but please don‚Äôt act on your mind‚Äôs negative inclinations. Try to replace those thoughts with positive stuff or distract yourself. If you can‚Äôt get rid of those thoughts then seek help fast before it gets worse. Also try listening to some positive self hypnosis tracks on YouTube right before you go to sleep. What you think about before sleeping and right after you wake up is really important so try to positively reaffirm your mind. Try it for a few weeks and hopefully you‚Äôll feel great. My DM is open if you‚Äôd like to talk more. Take Care!","Break up with him, move out of ur house, drop out of school and see if you get happier. Prolly that fam","Maybe you fear that these good times will end. One thing might get fucked. You are hyper anxienty. You need to get a hobby and release it all.

That's not the coward she's waiting for.","I dont mean to be rude but dude I honestly dont see how you came to the conclusion that killing urself is better than letting her go. Suicide is a more selfish option. Continue to try and change because if shes been here this long she really loves you. If you need to tho, let her go but dont kill urself man. Maybe it's the right girl wrong time? Stay strong ‚ù§Ô∏è","I would let her know what you are going through (as much as you are comfortable with, even saying just that you are having a hard time balancing everting) and tell her how much you love her because it seems like you love her a lot.

That's what I think.","You just have to let them know how you feel and let them know that you can help them find resources if they want. In the end, they have to choose to get help and get better. All you can really do is be positive and encourage them but also give them their space and not be too pushy otherwise they will never listen.

		"comments" : ["Amen.","First of all, it's not gone top far at U of T specifically, there are dialogues like this all over the country and the world in general. But this is largely because of the history behind the complaints which is one of the defining aspects of modern feminism. Man hating/complaints is largely due to the history behind them. For example, it is much more common for men to treat women like shit in relationships than women treating men in relationships like shit. It is much more likely to be seen as predatory when you're men looking at attractive women than women seeking attractive men from a distance. And showing off your partner is often seen as more of a physical game at who can get what they want from an attractive girl the most in terms of men, when with women it's mostly just a showing off at how their partner emotionally supports and cares for them in ways they love. It's the history of abuse and mistreatment and the callous attitude of people that don't fundamentally care or attempt to correct this type of behavior is what annoys and spurs on modern feminists in the way that we've seen. As a feminist, my personal problem with the movement is that we cannot decide between equity or equality as the ultimate destination of the movement. Meaning that we cannot decide if we are to consider equal treatment among women or provide an imbalance to atone for past years of unequal treatment. This is usually prevalent in the form of sexual expression which has been a method of controlling women for centuries. For example, why is it that we can have women literally running onto baseball fields and grabbing the asses of all the major league baseball members in the US but if the situation were in reverse it would be considered a crime. Or take for example, on the set of a famous X Men movie, Hugh Jackman was required to run naked during an escape sequence as wolverine and during one take, women working on set threw $1 dollar bills at him like he was a stripper, but if the situation were reversed it would be considered harassment.","Another example would be at how women are generally more likely to be seen as less predatory than men when seeking casual sex throughout going out and social settings. But the main problem lies in discerning between equity and equality, the two are not remotely the same and have vast implications on the social sphere of society as we know it. If women are equal to men, then we as a society don't need to think of these barriers consistently when we evaluate actions between men and women, they are the same. Nothing other than that. However, if we choose equity, we are acknowledging that men and women aren't the same. And therefore should be treated as such.","Anyone who hates people solely for their sex or gender isn't a feminist. They're just bigoted.","@justinrandall19 are you getting extra credit for this or something","@glamourdaze07 Nah, I just don't like it when people try to say things that aren't educated then pass it off as fact.","Feminism is wanting men and woman to be equal. Misandry is man hating. They are different. It‚Äôs not the actual feminists who are the problem","@brinabea I never said actual feminists are the problem, I just said that we cannot decide on the ultimate destination of feminism on whether or not we should pursue equality or equity because the two are fundamentally different as social policies.","Don't get confused by misandrysts who masquerade themselves as feminists.","Classic first world problem.","@justinrandall19 hope she sees this bro","Those are called feminazis, they don‚Äôt like men ! While Feminist fight for equal rights. I‚Äôm sorry if u encountered the feminazis instead of the good feminists.","@arjunsingh.1 incorrect","@justinrandall19 We ought to not choose equity, for the kind of treatment that we bestow upon people becomes arbitrary. Equality is the most practical (and constitutionally feasible) option.","Lol ya‚Äôll don‚Äôt know what feminism is it‚Äôs sad üòÇ","@justinrandall19 and she never said her comment has anything to do with you lmao","@uoftfoods I know but I was generally wondering if she agreed with me in everything I said up to a certain point.

Everyone fights their own hardships and this does not go on forever as the account said above. You have to give it a chance because you never know what‚Äôs waiting for you. These hardships, you will get past them with time so do not give up now. Please message someone, even if it isn‚Äôt me, because I know you may not think this, but your life is precious and worth living!!","you‚Äôre worth it and you‚Äôre not alone","You're life is worth everything","We‚Äôre all here for you.","@sad_little_marshmallow I do actually, which is why I commented.

Here u can work hard and get 80s but if you got classmates doing crap then you suffer bellcurved marks. And now sit at a 73-75. UofT probably only uni that bell curces down lolz. And the administration is an absolute nightmare. The stress of Osap and all these fuckall procedures with office of registrar is what messes the students. I don't doubt Waterloo studies are hard.

Took summer classes and got a 2.8 at the end of the summer after first year. Then second year hit me hard and my gpa tanked to a 2.4 again. I took time off school after second year due to my mental health issues then I came back and did much better in school - my gpa is now 2.9. I‚Äôm in my 5th year (3rd officially due to credits).

Some people can get busy tho. Anyway you can try me if you want.","I can't promise to be a bestfriend and stuff but if you dm me I'll always reply","I'll reply no matter what cuz I know the feeling, the same thing has happened to me like 3 times already","I'm literally on this thing 24/7, I am the opposite of dry, super wet. So DM me","its not necessarily their intention. its natural for people to wanna help others when they see people in need. so the impulse is to offer to help. but most of the time, they wont have the time and care to help them for an extended period of time.","Facctssss!! Man's taking shots üî´üî´üî´. Yasss I'm so proud of you fellow anonymous poster . ‚ù§Ô∏è","@owenhu99 if they are unable to at least respond to messages then they should not offer help.","@usamah.20 i agree, im just saying that people arent necessarily doing this deliberately to feel good about themselves","Don't take it personally. Some of us deal  with our own struggles, it's just life and it can be difficult for anyone. Reach out if you need someone to listen but understand that we are not trained for this. Finding a therapist that vibes well with you is really the best option","Okay but how many people do you think actually take us up on our offers?

Dmed him and it was a meme fest","@amxum Amna knows what's up üôå","I mentioned a sentiment similar to this once in a comment once and the just of the comment was: while I do think dming these people can help, if the issue is serious, my first thing I‚Äôd think to do is get professional help","Finally lmaoooo. These niggas in the comments everytime ‚ÄúOMG dm me‚Äù no amount of dming can solve depression. U just gotta die straight up that‚Äôs the only way out.","@hashemsalmon would that be the next one?","@utscbigthonk if ü§î a depressed person üò• got beef ü•© with u üòé just wait... üíØüíØüíØ","@pedrogaissler bro just stop commenting about this in general","@hashemsalmon its pretty hard when about 103% of the confessions are about suicide","@utscbigthonk ur a fucked human being","@huu_eyy don‚Äôt hate the player hate the game."],

If that doesn't really work then try to expand the number of friends you hang out with either with her or without ( distracts you and gives you more to talk about with her) . Finally, if those things don't work, then I'd say move on, cause as hard as it might be your emotions could hurt you in the long run ( making new friends, grades, finding your own significant other) if she's really that important to you.","Clearly express that you still have feelings for her and rhat being in this relationship is hurting you significantly. Then let her decide if it's all that important for her friend to be friends with her boyfriend. Sometimes you just have to let people know where you stand in life and let them make a decision based off of your feelings. Nothing else but that really."],

This is bulimia and it will kill you if you keep going by making you lose an unnatural amount of weight and write your esophagus which cannot be replaced. Your body is a beautiful thing and it doesn't deserve to be treated in the manner that you're treating it. Therefore you need to call mental health services before you significantly injure yourself or others because this is not normal behavior and it can be extremely addictive because of the relief it feels of purging your body. Stop the addiction before it starts.","Don‚Äôt wait till your super hungry to eat, eat slowly and around people you love.

And I‚Äôm pretty sure reposting that picture is a sign of protest and awareness for that injustice that happened, not some trending moral herd lol.","it's almost like people can care about more than one issue at a time üòë","This post was clearly written by a man","Fuck this ignorant post","With all do respect; props to you for recognizing that what happened is a ‚Äúbad thing‚Äù ... congrats?? What happened was not a bad thing but something HORRIBLE and absolutely disgusting. It should not bother you or concern you that people are posting this or ‚Äúblowing it out of proportion‚Äù because frankly, that‚Äôs the way it needs to be. If you‚Äôre a decent human being with a shred of humanity you would understand consent. But there are thousands out there who DON‚ÄôT, in that case any sort of awareness is needed to continue to spread the message.This young girl KILLED herself because she was asked to hold up her underwear in a courtroom and was told straight to her face that her rapist wasn‚Äôt found guilty because of her choice to wear lacy underwear. So no, this isn‚Äôt a small problem and people aren‚Äôt blowing it out of proportion. Sure there are big problems out there that we should focus on as well but that does not belittle this problem.","@_wwxo_ due*","I shared the image to spread AWARENESS. The fact that this event even occurred is mind blowing and the fact that you have the audacity to make a post shaming ppl for posting it is mind blowing. Think about what message you‚Äôre sending before you submit this shit","@anjana.s and the fact is this 17 yr old girl‚Äôs suicide is fucking tragic. Yes there are bad things happening in this world but can you stop and realize that her life meant something. Her story means something. This case needs to be talked about bc rape and victim shaming STILL HAPPENS","@_wwxo_ AMEN üôèüèª","I don't wanna be that bitch but...you are literal human trash. Take several seats","Okay but y r u so quick to judge? What makes you think ppl are only doing this because others are? This is how awareness is spread, and if you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt share it. But you‚Äôve got no right to decide if what people post is ‚Äòherding‚Äô or not. Those people probably care more about this issue than u do. Stop trying to put this movement to shit (it won‚Äôt work)","That's the thing it ISNT an anomaly. In 2001 a GIRL KILLED HERSELF because she was forced to hold up her thong in court as evidence. And now in fucking 2018 it's happening all over again to ANOTHER girl. That's disgusting. That's why as much awareness should be spread as possible so something can be changed","How do u know why people are doing it? Literally fucking bye","Stfu","If there are \"way more serious challenges and atrocities\" in the world why are you so hung up on peoples intentions behind their posts? Why aren't you paying attention to those? Who are you to say this is a less challenging or atrocious act? If you were raped and your underwear was used as evidence to prove consent I'm sure the issue would be \"way more serious\" as you would say. Really disappointing to see this type of mentality..","with that kind of mentality nobody will speak up about this so why don‚Äôt you keep your mouth closed üòò","Oh just fuck off","Please gtfo","@jp3ri","@zainabsiddiqi_ agreed","@anjana.s js she didnt commit suicide lol","yo whoever posted this is a fucking man. Get out. just fucking leave. you just jump to conclusions that people are following a trend when really we are speaking up as a whole ass gender that we shouldnt be sexualized by what we wear. We shouldnt have to be scared that were gunna get raped due to out undergarments. this is absolute foolishness and youre full of fucking shit. thanks have a shit night","@uoftfoods ok then tell me how Lindsay Armstrong is dead right now","@anjana.s u realize thats a case from 2001-2 right?","The stupid judge who let a rapist go free didn't know that apparentlyüòíüòí","Oh nononononono","People get mad if something gets  too much attention and people get mad if something gets no attention at all. Y‚Äôall are never happy.","The point of as many people reposting it is to show solidarity since this is clearly still an issue. If it was a non issue i would understand, but how is more people showing support a bad thing? Dumbass","shut up","@zainabsiddiqi_ Loads of genders out there, how you gonna be sure?

Questioning your identity is totally normal and valid, no matter what you decide at the end of it. Take as much time as you need to figure it out, and don't be afraid to reach out to the community even if you're not sure, we've all been there and we understand.

Its right across from Sidney Smith, its run by LGBTOUT and its purpose is for the volunteers to be active listeners when you need someone to talk to!","Don't worry! It took me a year to realize I'm bi. Dm me if you ever want to chat! I also feel out of the community sometimes since I'm dating a man","@just_incapable yes!! Come to chill and rant everyone here is super nice and welcoming üòä","Literally took me all of high school to accept myself as bi, everyone is on their own journey and people are constantly changing so don't worry about being confused or unsure, just try things until you figure it out. I had no queer friends until this year tbh so I feel you. The LGBTOUT drop in centre on campus is a super great place to meet queer friends and theres lots of resources and queer events. Just reach out and you can make some friends like I did!","hey it‚Äôs taken me a long time to accept the level of gay that i am on, there are a bunch if groups on campus u can join with like minded people who will welcome you, questioning is ok and perfectly normal. if you still feel hella lonely and need a friend hit me up!"],

I'm in ECE 1st year too, hmu hon","I‚Äôve had people in the past who I thought were friends (in high school for example) but only later did I realize were like this as well. I‚Äôm sure you probably already thought this but I guess try and find new friends. If you wanna talk, you‚Äôre free to dm me.","You need to find meaningful relationships worth the effort to be there for them and vice versa","It's better to be alone with no \"friends\" than to be alone around others. You'll find that it gives you more clarity and understanding of yourself and what's around you. Then, with that understanding your definition of relationships will become more refined. It'll be hard in the beginning, but in the long run you'll look back at these moments as being among your formative experiences. No pain, no gain right?","Lemme guess.....ur a gamer? I know how you feel bro. My friends call me ‚Äúretarded‚Äù ‚Äúget away from us stalker‚Äù and ‚Äúpedophile‚Äù daily simply because I am trying to show them my Minecraft mods. It‚Äôs time to take the world by storm. 2013 is our year!","cutting off toxic people hurts less than keeping them and makes room for the good people","Um you need to cut them out. Being alone is sooo liberating. You need to find yourself. Cut them out and find your hobby and passion. Trust me you'll become friends with people who share your interest and appreciate you for it. Everyone is bagging on you because neither you or them see what your specialities are. They have their personalities in tact. Like one might be the artsy type, one an athlete, and etc. But you need to find your stereotype* as dumb as it sounds, it is true. Once you find your spark then you can hang with anyone without feeling less-than the rest. ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ó"],

You should definitely not kill yourself but if you do then you know that you were totally open to your parents about what is going on and they new damn well and didn't make it better. Or if they don't listen you find another  way to deal with it. Spend less time at home, move out. Find something to bring you joy. There has to be more than an abusive sister bringing up these thoughts. Sorry I don't remember your last confession.","If you need some way to get out of the house reach out to a friend or family member so you can escape the toxic situation. Even if that will piss your parents off it‚Äôll show them that this is serious for you. Remember that all your friends and family will be forever heartbroken and affected if you choose to hurt or kill yourself. Use your support system, you can do this.","Take it from someone who was parked by a bridge for 3 hours wanting to jump off yesterday and not have anyone to talk to... I know it may seem like death is the only option but please DM me and let me be there for you. Please!","nono ok listen- i know its hard trust me. but if you feel comfortable going to the police now is really the time because this is abuse and harassment. you dont deserve to live this way babe... please go to the police before you do something that will take away your life forever. death is never the only option... i promise you. it may feel like it but it‚Äôs not we will find a way i promise. dm me if you wanna cry or talk or if you just need a hug im here to support you any way possible.","@loganhoohing just bc she has her own issues does not give her the right to abuse and inflict mental and physical pain upon you. thats not how life works.","You are going to have to call the police and press charges and get then  some counseling to help you. I know it sounds drastic to charge your own sister but honestly if there's no other way and this is how is being you feel then you need to do it. Btw, what she is doing is called domestic violence, there is a lot of help for you. Feel free to pm me and I can give more advice or direction","@estherr.0 her parents don't do anything or don't believe her (I think )","Like I said before, communication is important, tell her how you feel. Distance yourself from her or bring your bond closer. Choose one and you life could change dramatically for the better.

But at the same time universities have a massive revenue loss which will be reflected in the quality of our education; we‚Äôre paying more for less. So not only do richer families lose out, but at the same time this isn‚Äôt a labor intensive economy, people going into services now don‚Äôt have the ability to actually pay for their education and are left essentially economically alienated from any advancement opportunities. Also investing money into low income families thereby allowing them to pay for university education stimulates the economy as a whole. ‚ÄúThe one time‚Äù fr rich people never get any breaks we acc oppressed af time to rise up against the low income population barely making ends meet every month by taking their kids education away üòÇ üòÇ","Do it so i can make post with my shit grades","@utscbigthonk bro u acc spit facts aside from all the gamers rising up, lemme tip my fedora to you in 2007","@utscbigthonk ok i see and understand your point. but who ever said we were rich? im barely making ends meet as well. find a way where my parents arent suffering every month and a way where peoples ‚Äúfree education ‚Äú isnt taken away. remember, the government gouges us middle class for money for the lower class. i pay for that education and im struggling to pay for my own and i get no help from the government- who i repeat i give money to every pay. but you want everyone else to have education comfortably except us. ok champ! i dont wanna take anyone‚Äôs education away because some people really fucking deserve and need it. but i need an education too. i need to be able to pay for that too. sorry.","@utscbigthonk listen, im looking at it from both sides. there are people on both sides who need 2 different things to happen and i agree that the government should find a way. i know so many people who NEED osap to go to school and get an education and cant afford it. but then theres also middle class people SUFFERING to pay everything out of pocket because osap says ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt eligible‚Äù without looking at everything else we‚Äôre paying for. both sides are barely making it and honestly the government was gouging middle class and now theyre digging into the lower class.. and both ways its not good. i cant keep paying the taxes they want me to pay, its fucking outrageous, and so is paying everything and not even getting $2 from osap - at the same time people need osap or theyll have to drop out bc they cant afford school. sooo... i feel torn. so dont come after me saying i dont want me people to not have education. i want EVERYONE to have affordable education.","Doug Ford can kiss my ass I‚Äôm in lol.","Ya just go protest in this cold weather lol","#yellowvestprotests"],

Caring about one issue doesn‚Äôt negate our ability to care about another and your entire argument here is just one jumbled logical fallacy.","Fuck this ignorant post pt 2","You guys will do just about anything to discredit the suffering of women. People who say this probably wouldn‚Äôt even care about Yemen on any other day","@spamraysyed yeah, its sad that that issue doesnt get enough attention but dont use it to derail a completely unrelated conversation","You could use this argument for anything that ppl want to care about. Next.","The rape of a minor and a war is not the same thing. One does not compare a football team with a debate team. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs terrible that people in Flint don‚Äôt have clean water, but you know what, there are children starving in refugee camps, they shouldn‚Äôt complain.‚Äù They‚Äôre both horrible. They don‚Äôt negate each other. This logic is actually one of the reason why rape culture persists, people like you try to belittle incidents that are actually pretty impactful and harmful. You think this is this the only minor rape victim in Ireland who‚Äôs case was dismissed for trivial reasons? They‚Äôd do fucking common that someone wrote a YA novel about that. Do you know how many women‚Äôs rapists are acquitted because of what underwear or clothing they‚Äôre wearing, but they never come to public light? Do you know how many male victims of rape and sexual assault aren‚Äôt believed? But it is pointless to point all of this out to you, because you are so entrenched in the rape culture, that even if it happened to someone YOU loved (which I hope to God, for their sake never happens), you‚Äôll probably ask them what they were wearing. Yes, a lot of hypocrites jumped on the bandwagon, but guess what, even THEIR ignorant hashtags spreads awareness. Because guess what, wearing a thong does not mean that a 17 year old wanted to get raped by a 27 year old, and if you cannot get why people are upset and angry and trying to do something about it, maybe you should take a big hard look at yourself.","I wish people would think logically before posting üôÑ"],

Do something other than intoxicate yourself.","@lenny.vdl","@arjunsingh.1 While I agree that alcohol should be enjoyed in moderation, just because people wish to buy alcohol or purchase it later at night doesn't mean that they intend to purchase it for the purposes of purely intoxication. Generally lots of people don't have time to go to bars or purchase alcohol until later at night because of work or classes that don't end until late thus they don't have time to get it during LCBO's unreasonable hours. Especially when neighboring countries like the United States and even countries in Europe are at least allowed to sell liquor until 2 am (sometimes even around the clock). Therefore, people should be free as adults to purchase liquor during later hours at night provided they can prove themselves to be responsible about it.","@justinrandall19 I accept your argument about responsibility and time constraints. However, I feel personally that alcohol ought not to be consumed. It harms ones health and may cause death (through liver cirrhosis), notwithstanding the addictiveness and massive opportunity cost. The only reason it‚Äôs still legal is because prohibition is impractical and it provides massive tax revenue.","@arjunsingh.1 You are perfectly entitled to your belief, however I also feel that it's impractical and ignorant to how people view substances and consumption as a whole. There are tons of foods and drinks that are almost as equally destructive to your health as alcohol that are still completely legal, why should alcohol be banned? It is proven that a steady diet of fast food and caffeinated sugary drinks will easily lead to a swift and fairly painful demise because of its tendencies to cause heart attacks and diabetes. In addition, the food largely causes fatigue and substantial energy losses that impede function, provided it's not NEARLY as much as alcohol, but it's enough to be noticeable. In addition, robbing people of the choice to consume alcohol is largely impractical and ineffective due to past examples of prohibition and illegal distribution centers in areas that illegalize it. Lastly, it also robs humans of their free will to consume substances that are harmful to a reasonable degree, and impedes function as a responsible adult. Wouldn't you agree that humans shoould be allowed to make certain choices at their discretion?","@justinrandall19 Humans ought not to have the freedom to consume harmful substances that are intoxicants and psychotropics to any reasonable degree. They are far more harmful than any fast food in both the short and long terms (in the latter case, they lead to death quickly). By that logic, we should legalize all drugs. The reason they are presently banned is their addictiveness ‚Äì which is much more prevalent than fast food. Ideally, alcohol should be banned ‚Äì but cannot due to its decades entrenchment in society (which would make all prohibition meaningless). This is, likewise, one of the issues with legalizing cannabis right now."],

Literally so many things that you can do.","@i.jordanmunoz You won't be saying that when you have to pay 140 for gas and emptying your wallet to use your dryer like with Wynne","@arne.srb I don't drive a car. It's also not necessary to get around in the city. Carbon pricing is necessary to fight anthropogenic climate change.","@i.jordanmunoz it'll be necessary when we have a viable alternative, the way it stands they were just blackmailing us. And you didn't answer about hydro","@wildurbanchic Why PP? There's way better places to donate to that aren't controversial","@arne.srb That‚Äôs your opinion. Planned Parenthood provides free female healthcare to impoverished communities in the Western World, but go off.","@wildurbanchic It's not an opinion it's a fact that they're generating controversy","@wildurbanchic Do you know how expensive Pap smears, breast cancer screenings, HPV and STD screenings are? Or even maternal care? Do you know how many women in the West do not have access to decent prenatal care because of poverty? PLANNED PARENTHOOD addresses that. So yeah, they should donate to Planned Parenthood because not everything is about politics.","@wildurbanchic also, what is this conspiracy?","Dm me if you‚Äôre feeling generous üò©üò©üò©","@wildurbanchic their controversy is the way they handle abortions, if what American conservatives say is true then they're really not handling aborted fetuses right. It doesn't matter how much good someone does they can still do shady stuff on the side, or at least land in controversy for accusations of it like Kavanaugh, that kind of mentality that someone doing good things makes them immune to criticism or unethical behavior is why the Japanese have such a hard time getting rid of organized crime","@arne.srb ‚ÄúIf what conservatives say is true‚Äù? Do you not know how to fucking research? Also, did you just link women‚Äôs healthcare to organized crime? And what shady stuff are they doing? Can you back that up with credible resources? Anyone can make claims.","@wildurbanchic I'm not researching because it's not the point, people get into controversy all the time because people don't do research, and then something you intended to be benign like donating to PP can cause division because of the overly political world we live in","@arne.srb People don‚Äôt do research? We go to a research university, dude. Also, you cannot make wild claims without backing them up with this little thing called FACTS. Also, if your charity is heavily politicized, it isn‚Äôt fucking charity.","@wildurbanchic We don't all do the same research, for one. And for two it doesn't have to be people here, it could be people in their family. And I'm not sure how saying PP is controversial is a wild claim when there's almost always Republicans saying crap about them.","@wildurbanchic I also combed through everything and I don't think anyone said charity, plus I think PP is funded by gov't","@arne.srb blackmailing? Lmao. This is my last response.","@arne.srb It‚Äôs not a charity. It‚Äôs a non-profit. And it‚Äôs being funded by the government because they don‚Äôt want to pay for healthcare. I never called it a charity. I was talking about charitable actions. And I‚Äôm not asking you to do the same research, I‚Äôm just asking you to DO IT. And facts are facts. There are no alternatives. At least when it comes to healthcare.","@wildurbanchic You're getting lost on something, all I said is that it's a dicey game to donate to controversial entities because you can get backlash for it","@arne.srb Oh, I am getting lost on something? What an I getting lost on? If according to you, we live in an extremely political world, then there is no cause free of controversy. So I will defend Planned Parenthood and all the good it does against meaningless rhetoric like yours.","@wildurbanchic I just said what you got lost on, misinterpreting my point. The world is extremely political but not everyone has to cause controversy, not everything touches on hotly debated things like abortion","@arne.srb yeah, but abortion is not even the main part of their operation. Hospitals provide abortions too, would you boycott their cancer charities?","@wildurbanchic no because those funds won't go into the costs of abortions. I wouldn't choose where the money would go if I donated to PP, it could end up saving a girl's life, or taking away the life of someone who never even got to experience much of their life","@arne.srb that is such bullshit. They have targeted fundraising. And you do know that abortions are funded by taxes in the Canadian healthcare system, right? Also, NOBODY is asking YOU to donate to Planned Parenthood. It was a suggestion. They could choose to donate or not. Freedom of choice. No one is forcing anyone to donate anywhere."],

You can also just explain to people what you identify as. A lot of people might not be educated about this. Be more forgiving for fucks sake.

How Asian Canadians adopt the colonizers frameworks and forget our own cultural traditions and structures? This nigga is really gassing the muddled identity of a diasporic group and renouncing all relations to his true home. Sad.","I am literally the colour of wet mayonnaise yet people still ask me where I‚Äôm from. It‚Äôs not about race.","I mean I do that shit too lol it's curiosity","lol I‚Äôm european and people still ask where I‚Äôm from. Nothing to do with you being brown lol","@utscbigthonk Nah, you‚Äôve got it wrong bud. Traditions connect us to the past, not the future. Assimilation is key for unity as a nation. Absence of assimilation results in ethnic tribes/clans (e.g. Chinatown). That‚Äôs counterintuitive to building a nation. We, as Canadians, are not a geographic nation for all values and traditions. For example, FGM (a tradition that is supposed to ‚Äúconnect one to their ancestors‚Äù)is common in places like Somalia. Canadians do not tolerate such practices or so called traditions. We believe in democracy, individualism, human rights and hard work. You‚Äôre feeling sad for people who assimilate. Why are they here in the first place? If they love their ‚Äútrue home‚Äù, why not stay there? Or are they here for the welfare checks the government gives them?","@nathanjeya98 I like how you immediately connect traditions to something as brutal as FGM. Also why are ideas such as individualism, and democracy 1) not possible within other cultural frameworks and 2) even considered as something important or necessary? Imo those are two useless values. Look at what the countries who consider themselves the largest ‚Äúdemocracies‚Äù and ‚Äúindividualist‚Äù nations on the planet do, ie exploitation, war, imperialism, the list goes on. Also buddy the entire point of Canada is a multicultural nation which isn‚Äôt a melting pot, but an assemblage of various traditions and elements. And largely many immigrants from Asia, Latin America, Africa for example are in the West because of the violence enacted upon their homes by these same actors whether it be direct or indirect influence. Sure assimilation is key to unity of a nation, but isn‚Äôt it sad that beautiful cultural traditions such as for example Aboriginal languages and customs, various cultural elements from other groups etc are torn and ripped apart in the name of ‚Äúassimilating‚Äù into the very nations who destroyed their homes in the first place? And then to celebrate this same alienation as some kind of victory is stupid af. Look at you for ex, a man from the Indian subcontinent I‚Äôm assuming. Sure the Mughals and central Asians controlled India first, but they allowed for various religious and cultural groups to exist. Only in British colonialism were Indians meant to transform into ‚ÄúBritish subjects‚Äù (ofc not in rights tho). So they came they raped our women, stole our cultures, and educated our children with their literature, traditions, customs and ideas and we are supposed to thank them by assimilating into their nations? You assume all foreign cultures are ‚Äútraditionalist‚Äù while apparently Canada is some modern and progressive assemblage that exists outside any connection to the past although a rudimentary understanding of our legal or political systems would easily debunk that. Stop being a Canadian cuck man our own cultures need not bow down to some man with a tim hortons cup.","@utscbigthonk Geez, it says a lot about you as a person when you say democracy and individualism are useless values. You‚Äôre setting a model example of the type of person Canadians don‚Äôt want in our country. Never did I say that these values are not possible in other cultural frameworks. Democracy is fundamental for maintaining equality through freedom of speech and . Individualism is what makes us think outside the box and come up with new, creative, and innovative ideas. It allows us to follow our passion. I actually don‚Äôt promote the multiculturalism policy either. It basically promotes the idea that we don‚Äôt have a core identity when in fact the policy in and of itself was put forward on a population that had a national identity. The policy of multiculturalism doesn‚Äôt promote assimilation either. There are people that have been living in this country for several years and don‚Äôt speak either of the official languages because they‚Äôve segregated themselves into their ethnic tribes. Wow, and we come back to the very thing that this confession is all about. Assumption of people‚Äôs background. Why are you assuming? Melanin on my face shouldn‚Äôt make you think I‚Äôm from India. WTF? I thought you‚Äôre a ‚Äúbig thinker‚Äù and  a ‚Äúpublic intellectual‚Äù, unless what you put on your profile was sarcasm of course. Also I don‚Äôt care about India‚Äôs history because it‚Äôs irrelevant to Canada. Natives are integral to the Canadian identity and I do acknowledge that European settlement on this land has made an immense disservice to them especially by the implementation of the Indian Act. However, we can‚Äôt move forward as a nation if we keep feeling guilty about it. We learn from them and we move on. Also, whites in power have made a great effort to even out the playing field. There‚Äôs not such thing as white scholarships or white affirmative action. In fact, there‚Äôs scholarships for pretty much all minority groups including the indigenous people. Assimilation is key for the future of this country and to maintain a core identity. I‚Äôve spent too much time for this. After all, it‚Äôs a meme and I‚Äôm only expressing my beliefs. Good luck and cheers!","@nathanjeya98 Pointlessly and blindly parading individualism and democracy as theoretical values is useless. Let‚Äôs look at what these democratic countries have actually used these ideas for, largely to suppress the economy viability of huge parts of the domestic population in the name of ‚Äúindividualism‚Äù an idea increasingly confused in today‚Äôs globalization, and democracy which is a tacit implication that the aggressive actions and impositions of force from one country into another are justified through this hierarchy of political systems. Sure some American might see American democracy as something great, but I can‚Äôt say the same for the Latin amercians who have seen its brutality, and role in shutting down their own democratic ideals. Your lack of knowledge on this history is appalling. You even go so far as to say ‚ÄúIndian history doesn‚Äôt matter in relation to Canada‚Äù what? These Western countries many Indians inhabit for example the UK or America have deep roots to Indian history whether through colonialism or the coolie trade. To simply tell some Asian, African, Latin American etc person that their history doesn‚Äôt matter, in relation to the same countries whose violence plays a large role in their history is just stupid af and shows a lack of intellectual nuance on your part in relation to the historical and academic relevance of these previous structures, which as many academics rightly point out are the same@lives histories of these diasporic people today. And actually you directly implied that foreign countries couldn‚Äôt be progressive because you painted them as ‚Äútraditionalist‚Äù and living in the past, even relating Somalia only to FGM as if this captures the entire essence of a country. You then said Canada believes in democracy and individualism, to@posit its progressivism in direct contrast to the previous ‚Äústuck in the past‚Äù definition you have of foreign cultures. So not only does your discourse privilege certain ideas over others arbitrarily, but also certain countries implicitly. And I assumed you‚Äôre Indian because of your name buddy.","@utscbigthonk Furthermore this idea younhave that only individualism promotes innovation is largely debunked if we consider the vast majority of technological innovations in the last century have been massively publicly funded and no sole idea is individually produced. Take an iPhone for example, put together by thousands of engineers and govt technology, mass produced by foreign Chinese workers, and then shipped by massive international networks. Are we going to attribute this sole idea to Steve jobbs, who didn‚Äôt even invent the vast majority of technology involved? No man is an island unto himself brother and these flawed notions of individualism have lead to the massive divides in wealth that lead to the formation of political elites and political instability in various contexts both in the global north and global south. And wtf? We should just learn and move on from the aboriginal case? This may be the luxury of us here in Toronto but not of the aboriginals living in reserves or northern territories both alienated from proper economic integration, infrastructure, and even clean water and housing. To move into metropolitan areas however guarantees a further loss of culture, once again one violently taken from them. What point does an aboriginal scholarship to university have when some of these reservations don‚Äôt even have actual schooling facilities? I‚Äôve never seen this level of cuckery to the west ever before.","@panderson6 AHAHAHAHAHAH"],

You're not taking into account the population that feels trapped in school who don't even party or 'waste time'; maybe the ideal path to their passions isn't very university based and they'd much rather be doing something more college or non-school related, such as sound production or the trades as some examples. University isn't a one stop shop for every ideal life outcome out there. Also I think the way you condemn partying is a little extreme, people who want some friend time or me time aren't frauds.","You sound like you're a real fucking fun person to be around","@umipiggy if someone doesn't want to go here it's not like they need to.

Balancing out your passion with relaxation and times with friends is the way to go. It keeps what you love from becoming work.

Every  pathway is different with its own set of consequences, but there's a lot of people here only because of immense family or cultural pressure. The problem with this post is that it not only condemns how one uses their free time (which is ridiculous), but it also condemns people who are using the degree to figure themselves out as well as those who consider dropping out to switch with a sort of \"you're not trying hard enough\" attitude.

If you love him and vice versa then he'd understand that maybe he should cut back on the crisps and junk food","Since this is someone you love, you should make sure to not mention that you are finding him less attractive and approach this with a lot of sensitivity. Saying that will  destroy his confidence (someone has said that to me in the past). Also, it's quite normal for people to go through periods of weight gain and stress. Explain to him that you are concerned he is falling into bad habits and you want him to be healthy. Simple as that.","He is stressed. Maybe figure out that first since you hinting at his eating habits made no difference. And at this point you do feel unattractive to him. No matter what you say or how you approach it. If it is true love* then he will know right away that you don't find him attractive. So start making his meals and figure out what stresses him that he craves junk food. If it is family or work or school or friends or even you. Tell him he needs a timeout because it is effecting his mental health*. Mental health needs to be fixed. The physical health gets better right away because right now the dude blind and seeing foggy. He will realize himself he has totally let go. But point blank talking to him will just make him defensive and feel shit. He might also leave you because irrationality and also because internally u do feel unattracted. It's just weight. Look past it and acknowledge his character and he defo changed in his character to so talk to him about that. Say he use to be upbeat and energetic. He has no time for both of you to go to thw gym. He should make time with you. And y'all feel sluggish. Thats immediate actions he can take to make u happy. Weight loss takes time and has become something super toxic to discuss tbh. So pick your poison. Talk to him directly and it really won't do much. Or make the efforts on your end physically.  Make the meals. Make him quit a shift and go to gym with you. Say u don't like working out alone. Partners tend to mirror each other. So lead by example."],

Though I agree with one of the above comments where he should put more emphasis on the environment. It also matters.","Trump caring for ‚Äúhis country‚Äù means he cares about other white supremacists who‚Äôre adamant to deporting anyone who isn‚Äôt white, believing that if you‚Äôre of different racial background BORN in America you aren‚Äôt truly American. What about the fact that his family must‚Äôve immigrated to America before he was born hm???? Let‚Äôs not forget the fact that these ‚Äúwhites‚Äù slaughtered the indigenous peoples of America and took it over. So next time someone says he‚Äôs doing his for his country, please open a history textbook  xx","@estherr.0 It‚Äôs not okay for illegals to jump the immigration queue that law abiding citizens have gone through. How is that fair? Country‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be open to any everyone. A tough immigration process ensures proper vetting of people such as whether they have any criminal history or was a child rapist. Justin Trudeau has done the opposite by opening our doors to illegals and inviting Syrian refugees that were not properly vetted. As a result, a thirteen year old Canadian girl, Marissa Shen, was murdered by his ‚ÄúSyrian refugee‚Äù. This could‚Äôve been avoided completely!! It‚Äôs outrageous and makes your blood boil. The media is so left wing that it doesn‚Äôt sufficiently show both sides of the story.","@nathanjeya98 I agree this never should‚Äôve happened, and it‚Äôs a horrible thing that did happen. Every single refugee is specially chosen and screened by not only Canadian immigration people but by the States as well. They only accept families and people most work in a trade that Canada has a shortage for (ex. Electrician). By bringing in well-trained Syrian refugees although sure costs money upfront, actually stimulates the economy and the refugees will more than payback what they paid for. It‚Äôs also the decent thing to do. Obviously there are bad cases like the one you mentioned but over 99% of refugees help Canada in the long run","Meh overall he‚Äôs no better than Hillary‚Äôd have been. Better than her on trade, worse than her on race and gender. She destroyed Libya creating the situation that literally led to open slave trading and would‚Äôve done similar things as president. He apparently decided to take kids away from their parents and put them in cages. She called black guys ‚Äúsuper predators‚Äù, he called climate change a ‚ÄúChinese hoax‚Äù. America was screwed before the 2016 elections even started.","Ok but a president shouldnt be saying \"grab her by the pussy\" like??? How are you gonna defend that","@thejakegaudet Appreciate your response and I‚Äôm trying to wrap my head around these issues. It‚Äôs hard to do so when you look into both the news from our mainstream and news from outside the mainstream like this one [  https://youtu.be/3U6IJZ75BJ0 ].","i wish we could just have conversations about this without cancel/outrage culture getting in the way. how can we expect to understand eachother and learn deeper truths about our world at large if we don‚Äôt accept that some people may have misinformed views and try to teach them otherwise? then again this feeds into the problems in our educational system but ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø","@nathanjeya98 I by no means am a Justin Trudeau supporter, yet at the same time I don‚Äôt believe because we are born here we have some claim over it. If I did I would also have it admit that we are on native land, but let‚Äôs face it we aren‚Äôt.","@thejakegaudet I‚Äôm also a bit ambiguous on the rebuttals people use when they say we‚Äôre on natives land. Canada became a country after Europeans settled on the land. Canada was predominantly built by Europeans.  Had they not settled on the land, wouldn‚Äôt this so called land that we call Canada today be a bunch of natives with teepees? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","i agree","The problem is that it appears Donald Trump may not have had his country‚Äôs best interests in mind when he and his campaign engaged in a conspiracy to undermine American democracy in order to be elected president","Some may point to the relative success of the stock market under his presidency as a sign of economic success, yet it is important to remember that 80% of shares are owned by the top 10% of earners, so very few Americans are experiencing greater success than they did under Obama","@damyenryukazuki preach","@jasmine.z85 I don‚Äôt particularly like trump but categorizing him as a ‚Äòwhite supremacist‚Äô and other forms of alt right titles is misleading and to a large extent false. But for the sake of argument, let‚Äôs just say he is a racist dickhead. How does that play a part into defining him as a good politician or not? So long as he ensures the stability of domestic/international relations along with encouraging economic activity (ofc with the absence of tyranny and the maintenance of a liberal democracy), he‚Äôll be doing a good job. Also can you get me the info suggesting that trump supports xenophobic individuals and the deportation of immigrants (because preaching that is retarded since expats are legit a fundamental part of the economy). Anyways I‚Äôm not an ideologue and I‚Äôm speaking from a neutral view. Wanna hear your take on this.","@jad_sibai okay but what exactly has he done that‚Äôs benefited the economy otherwise?? All he‚Äôs done is come across as a tyrant by threatening to have those not born American citizens (even though they earned it) to have their citizenship stripped away. He‚Äôs encouraged nationalism multiple times, hence the neo-nazi rally a couple years back‚Äìhe never directly made any comments on how terrible organizing a rally like that is, he‚Äôs labelled all immigrants as illegal without thought. Trump is not a politician, he doesn‚Äôt think like one either, and he acts on a spur. He recently wanted to open an investigation into Clinton with no reason as to why and immediately got shut down because he had no basis. He evaded taxes several times. He wanted Jim Acosta‚Äôs pass to the White House taken because he didn‚Äôt like he questions CNN was asking. Is that a politician? Or someone who doesn‚Äôt want any opposition?","@jad_sibai want info regarding his xenophobia: https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/indepth/opinion/cost-xenophobia-trump-america-180803091125432.html","@nathanjeya98 @thejakegaudet that‚Äôs such a narrow view of what ‚Äúsettled‚Äù means. Indigenous people did have full on towns (Qu√©bec City and Montr√©al, for example, are built on Hochelaga and Stadacona). Also we *are* on Indigenous land. Among other nations throughout history, the most recent nation to have ownership (in a different sense of the word, since land ownership wasn‚Äôt a concept in local indigenous societies) over the Toronto area are the Mississauga of the Credit. The names ‚ÄúToronto‚Äù and ‚ÄúMississauga‚Äù come from local indigenous peoples (the Mississaugas, and ‚ÄúToronto‚Äù is a corruption of the Iroquois word ‚Äútkaronto‚Äù which means ‚Äúplace where the trees stand in the water‚Äù).","@tylerdriches I disagree, just because someone used to live where we now live doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs their land. For example, if we look at most of Europe, thousands of different groups of people have settled in most countries. Before every event in France do they have to give a ‚Äúland treaty‚Äù be like this is French land, than German land, than we owned it again, ... the Roman Empire ruled over for a bit, Ionian Greeks settled here before them, and the Carthagians. No they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs French land right now, who cares who was there first.","‚ÄúLand acknowledgement‚Äù*** my bad","@thejakegaudet you can‚Äôt make the false equivalency of ancient French territory when the territory that was acquired by Europeans was 1) acquired through genocide, cultural or physical, or dishonest negotiations 2) way more recent than the Roman Empire????? 3) people still very much live with the repercussions of European colonization. Your standard shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúyeah the French don‚Äôt care what happened to them thousands of years ago when modern day France was literally unrecognizable, so why should First Nations care what happened to them between 1492-the modern day?","@tylerdriches good points and I‚Äôm enjoying having this discussion with you.  1) I‚Äôm not saying that anything that happened was right, but that‚Äôs how life worked back than. The French did what they did and created ‚ÄúNew France‚Äù than the English walked in and did exactly what the French did to the indigenous peoples. Do we know owe the French as well? I‚Äôm Acadian, ever heard of ‚ÄúDeportation of Acadians‚Äù in Maritime provinces in the 1750s, where‚Äôs my cheap gas at? 2) where do we draw the line? Your arguing a point that‚Äôs 500 years old, what‚Äôs the difference between that and 1500? 3) modern day Canada was unrecognizable in 1492...?","@thejakegaudet ALSO I just realized how very wrong your first statement is. ‚ÄúJust because someone used to live where we live now doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs theirs.‚Äù What???? Europeans literally coerced the First Nations off their land. The land was *stolen*. We can‚Äôt just push them out, set up camp, and be like ‚Äúyeah just cuz they used to live here doesn‚Äôt mean this is there‚Äôs!!! finders keepers!!!!‚Äù Like lol huh???","@thejakegaudet yes I‚Äôve heard of the deportation of the Acadians. And idk the line seems pretty easy to draw at ‚Äúrighting the wrongs of the past by acknowledging that they *happened* and working to end the ongoing institutional and systemic racism and colonialism in our society.‚Äù Seems pretty clear cut.","@tylerdriches no the line isn‚Äôt clear. If we were to right every wrong the human race has ever done there is no stopping. We used to hang peggians as we believed they were witches. What do we give them to right our wrong? Where in history is the cut off? 500 years? 700 years? 1000 years? At which point do our wrongs not matter because it‚Äôs so many years ago? I think the world would be a better place if we just apologized and moved on, let‚Äôs make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again and be equals to each other. Also, there is no systemic racism that still occurs in the year 2018. The residential schools were a horrible thing, and I don‚Äôt think anyone will disagree with that. But in the current year I have never witnessed any ‚Äúsystemic‚Äù racism against the indigenous peoples, and i grew up beside the biggest reserve in Canada. I might be missing the racism or not seeing it somehow, please fill me in.","omg whyre people so blind","@thejakegaudet There very much is systemic racism in Canada, just because you can't see it or don't experience it doesn't mean it's not happening.  Indigenous people on average are paid less than white people.  The quality of life in a reserve is horrible, they dony always have access to clean water, they're very underfunded, child poverty rate is much higher in reserves than outside reserves.  Even the UN acknowledges the systemic racism against indigenous people in Canada.  Speak to an indigenous person who lives on a reserve and get THEIR experiences.  Keeping in mind of course that experiences differ.  Otherwise, it's not hard to Google this stuff.","@thejakegaudet Also, the difference between the witchtrials and indigenous genocide is that people are still dealing with the aftermath of the latter.  Residential schools aren't as far into the past as you may think.","@ema23malik You should also take into consideration that whites in power have made a great effort to even out the playing field. There‚Äôs no such thing as white scholarships or white affirmative action. In fact, there‚Äôs scholarships for pretty much all minority groups including indigenous people. From your response, I‚Äôm sensing that you believe whites need to feel guilty for what their ancestors did and I find that completely unacceptable and outrageous."],

		"comments" : ["Its not wrong to deny a platform to people who campaign based on misinformation and racism. Its that simple, now get over it.","Isn‚Äôt she an actual neo-nazi tho?","People who‚Äôre saying she‚Äôs a neo nazi better do their research. She was a journalist when she attended the ‚Äúunite the right‚Äù rally. It was her footage that was used all around the globe including CNN, FOX, and other mainstream medias and others. She only broadcasted neo nazis, she NEVER supported them. There‚Äôs a difference people. People say she‚Äôs a racist because she said the ‚Äú14 words‚Äù. But what‚Äôs wrong with it? If you replace white with black, asian, brown or any other ethnic groups/race, there would be no problem. What‚Äôs wrong with including white in it? Also she was a journalist merely conducting a thought experimental at that time. She also supports the one state solution for Israel and is against the bds movement. She‚Äôs not a frickin neo nazi lol. These are the things the media neglects to tell viewers.","She's not a neo nazis but she is still a major fucknut. There's a lot of room to be reprehensible between point a and point b.","You need to stop misconstruing holding contrarian views with ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù just because they exist outside of what the mainstream media reports. Ms. Goldy might not be a literal neo-Nazi, but this is somebody who has:  1. Claimed Canada should reroute immigration to Europe in order to be ‚Äú96% white again‚Äù 2. Takes endorsements from Richard Spencer (organizer of the Unite The Right rally, supporter of a white ethnostate) in stride 3. Expressed a desire to bring back carding if elected (which has been regarded as unconstitutional since being discontinued) in some misguided attempt to stem crime 4. Just for fun: Was criticized and dropped from a debate by Jordan Peterson (our boi, big advocate of ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù) because he found she associated with too many Nazis  Do I think censorship is the best way to deal with someone like this? No. Do I think pulling the fire alarm at a debate she was invited too was acceptable? No. That‚Äôs a discussion for another time. But Faith Goldy‚Äôs callous attitude towards the people that associate with her, and her reinforcement of the ideas they spread, shows what a joke she is to practically all of the political spectrum. She has nobody else to blame except herself for not doing anything about the narrative against her except cry ‚Äúglobalist‚Äù against dissenters in a desparate attempt to curry favour with the group of people who are most likely to respond to her ideas.  Somebody whose mayoral promises and beliefs are xenophobic and unconstitutional, demonstrate their lack of understanding of the social fabric of Toronto and Canada at large. Even if you poll 3rd, this is not somebody you should take seriously for a mayoral position, and clearly Canadian politicians and the media felt the same way.","@valenero Mind if I save this for future use?","@kaz_riz Not at all fam. Have a blessed day","@valenero It‚Äôs true. She carelessly associated herself with the wrong people before entering politics. There wasn‚Äôt even a doubt in my mind that she was gonna lose. But can you tell me where exactly I can find your evidence for points 1 and 2? I heard people say that too but I just can‚Äôt seem to find it anywhere.","@nathanjeya98 Here‚Äôs a screenshot of her saying Canada should be 96% Euro-Canadian: https://mobile.twitter.com/billyarmagh/status/1044343266739548160  Here‚Äôs her doubling down on that statement: https://mobile.twitter.com/faithgoldy/status/990367785820807169?lang=en  Here‚Äôs her retweeting Richard Spencer twice (which might have been a coincidence, but that just leads me to believe her digital literacy isn‚Äôt up to par either): https://twitter.com/Garossino/status/896536825547730948?s=20  I get it, these are on Twitter (arguably the worst social media for political discourse) and can be taken out of context. But how many times should someone give her the benefit of the doubt when she advocates views like this? Anyway, hope these are sufficient. Have a blessed day","@valenero can you plz msg me the comment? I can‚Äôt copy and past these urls apparently lol","@valenero yo I didn‚Äôt know hyperlinks wouldn‚Äôt fly in the comments üíÄ I promise I didn‚Äôt lie about what‚Äôs in those tweets üòÇ, but it‚Äôs gonna be harder to look them up this way","@valenero lmao üòÇ thanks man","@nathanjeya98 did she not do an interview with the daily stormer? asking for a friend","@_walkerza yeah she did.

Be the best version of yourself and a healthy relationship will just happen to you.","@k.kian relationship? What‚Äôs that?","Look for mr.right now. Who makes you feel great in the moment. Maybe it‚Äôll grow into a great relationship, maybe it won‚Äôt. Anyhow you‚Äôll either find your ‚Äúone‚Äù or it‚Äôll prepare you by teaching you something valuable about relationships. Look at every relationship as a prep course, before the big exam lmao","But think about this, what if u never find the one? It‚Äôs statistically possible that within your lifetime u won‚Äôt find the one. Therefore just live your life and find someone that you choose to be with because you want to. Get  rid of that idea of there only being one person for u.","Don‚Äôt stress too much on finding the one, when you least expect it she or he will come strollin into you life like a thunderbolt. I met my wife that way, she literally tripped and fell in to my arms when she was walking up the stairs to the top rows of lecture.. and that‚Äôs it that‚Äôs how our story began.","Every relationship takes work. If you leave this relationship, you'll probably realize that your next relationship has problems too. That's because nobody is perfect and someone being perfect for you might not mean what you think it does. \"The one\" is someone you can grow with and someone who is willing to try. Someone who challenges you to be a better version of yourself. If you find someone who is willing to stay and work on the relationship just as much as you are, stay with it. A person can have all the greatest qualities in the world, but if they run away the minute there is a conflict or things are less than perfect, then they could never be the one."],

		"comments" : ["There are not many but few who produce incredible work, but if you truly believe that your work is incredible and has potential reach out to other institutions.","The truth is that we're equally screwed with U of T and without it, prestige opens up a modicum of opportunities for some people and for others it practically gives a glorified shafting. Similarly, people with other universities have to do twice the work to get noticed for job opportunities, just assuming they have better GPAs it might just pay off if they manage to outrank a U of T student. Overall, university is simply another unlocker of opportunity in which the goal is a better job opportunity. Sometimes prestige can get you in one way, while hard work can get you in another way. Especially when graduate school is applied and people from lesser known universities can actually apply due to their higher gpa requirements.","UofT can make people homeless that's a fact it can also make you the best version of yourself depends how you approach it","@uoft","I kinda try to justify U of T's grading system and encourage myself to get over with bad marks by saying how it needs to maintain the quality of its A-grades as good as that of other universities in America as prestigious. Like it somewhat makes sense though if we think about it since we've had way less competition to enter a university considered one of the 25 best ones globally compared to our counterparts in American universities. This is because we compete to the same extent when we come here, not before.","@jakewilli21 Totally agree!","@edward_yoon_ spot on!","@edward_yoon_ But the point I'm trying to get across is we might start as barely \"well-trained\" students to achieve excellence at first, but we can become one by the time we graduate and grow to be as competitive as our counterparts in prestigious American or British universities. I've had this self-reflective problem myself, too. I've realized, however, that if I work really hard to achieve that good old excellence, I certainly will (and so will everyone else), and that's what's been pushing me to climb up the cliff.","The grading is tough, but UoFT isnt going to hold your hand. You have endless opportunity in your field through research, seminars and so much more opportunities. It's just your job to find it.","@nomaderrick shut up idiot"],

It was hard for him to accept my condition at first but he came around and is very supportive now. I would suggest have your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist sit with you and your parents and discuss it openly and honestly. If your parents have any questions they can ask your physician directly. By knowing now, your parents will have time to adjust to the news and support you :) Remember, you have to be patient with them as well since it will be new information for them. I hope this helps and best of luck. If you want to talk you can DM me :)","You need to tell people, start with your friends first. It's super important to have a good support group.

In Europe alcohol is associated with togetherness and moderate enjoyment with friends. Therefore it's so much more common for kids to get sips of alcohol and learn the rules of drinking far before they're of age. However, in anglo-saxon and primarily North American countries children are prohibited from drinking but adults are condoned for being drunk. Therefore alcoholism and even alcohol in general is associated with rebelliousness and edginess per se. Thus the reason why the rates of alchohlism and alcohol related incidents are much higher in North America. Thus, the phrase it's not the substance, it's how you use it, brings even more resonance over here at this point.","@jonkatz611","@josephstrauss22 I feel attacked","Doug is this you?","@justinrandall19 Preach üôå","Lmfao fucking trinity","@jonkatz611 you've been attacked","Fair","Shit still fun though, however I don‚Äôt condone bragging about it, that shits stupid","@siddvader333 these comments","@nextlilpump clearly you need to show this person how great alcoholism is xD"],

This is simply because you wanted to feel confident and assertive in ways you didn't feel like when you were with your ex.

This behavior tends to be common in people that feel unempowered, underappreciated, neglected or emotionally robbed in life. Always remember to get out your feelings and talk about how past relationships have affected you with someone just so that you can get that sense of closure and move on. Especially so that you don't duplicate them and become a worse person in the process like you were suggesting."],

Why you tryna start shit like this on a uoft insta page, go study","Miss me with that gay shit","In general, women have different social dynamics and power dynamics than men. Engaging in affectionate or sexual activity between man to man signifies taking on a female and therefore inferior role. Because of toxic masculinity, this behaviour is shunned by both men and women alike. Men see this as a threat to their own masculinity (if they get grouped into it by association) and a threat to their sexuality, while women might see it as weak or unattractive (worried you might be gay. Most contemporary women won't care). For female to female affection, whether it's platonic or sexual, is more widely accepted because these threats to femininity do not exist in the same way. If anything, the male gaze actually encourages and sexualizes female relationships because they are framed as \"for a man's pleasure.\" Because seeing women together would make men happy, women are more comfortable engaging in the behaviour and men are comfortable witnessing it (usually). The poem industry takes advantage of this. Either way, both types of interactions and their acceptance are dominated by its affect on men and revolves around notions on toxic masculinity. Feminism seeks to amend this so that everyone (both men and women) can be free from these limiting and inhibiting expectations.","@nittyarizza porn industry***","@_nitash @_richaa","#homiesexuality #allowit","They might get away with cuddling in some situations, but holding hands is clearly a couple....but who cares if someone's gay anyways?","@bradleyptbo they're both signs of intimacy, just hand holding is usually outside and a display of the status as in a relationship, whereas cuddling is more private, and can be nuanced in many ways","Sexuality is a social construct, created by the state","@nomaderrick uh"],

You better be prepped to dedicate any free time you have","Its not about getting in, it's about staying in. I'd advise you to know that you can't cram the night before and that you can't have he same study habits for every class. The program has very different courses that require you to put different amounts of work in and strategize different study plans. DONT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP and go to office hours!!!!!","Best advice I have is to start studying from day 1it will seem easy at first so u won't but then when you do problems you'll realize u didn't get it and now u have to study that plus what you're learning new times five courses and it sucks","Just work hard. Figure out your study habits and stay on top of readings. You can do it for sure. I actually recommend paying attention to your high school classes because there‚Äôs significant overlap in some subjects!!","Don‚Äôt do it to yourself","You also might need to adjust the way you take notes. Especially when you have 3 different profs in a chem class in one semester. If you like to write everything you might not always have time because at least with the 2nd prof she has a lot of equations and examples so it is best to print them but with the 1st one I could write it all down. This is just my opinion:))","Dont come here everywhere else has the same program but easier I wanna die here","I wouldn't recommend it unless you are 100% sure that it's what you want to do. I was really passionate and good at it in highschool but they really work you hard. I would suggest other schools with the same program if you aren't 10000% sure","Don't freak out over tiny failures. I know it seems like a big deal at the moment but keep working ahead and you'll make it for sure :)","LMFAO @soph_fefe knows","lmao good luck","@emily_sugianto @angelyn.xie","@alexapopp_ LOLLLLL","If you‚Äôre not 100% sure you like the sciences and want a career in the field, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. The work load is 100x worse when you‚Äôre not actually interested in what you‚Äôre doing.","^ this is so true. I‚Äôm in life science because I‚Äôm interested in psychology but not in anything else related to the program but it‚Äôs a lot more work. For me biggest thing was my study habits but if you‚Äôre not interested in chemistry and bio I wouldn‚Äôt recommend humanities and social science I find way more interesting but under arts and science gives you a lot of flexibility. I‚Äôd say take courses you find interesting and worry about majors and minors for 2nd year","@lizamarkovaa taking the math course you're supposed to take might've helped ease that lmao","I am first life sci year and dieing","@pamirhankaya cevap versene","My advice is if you're completely sure you want to go into life science, are really passionate about it, and have a goal, go for it! But if it's not really what you want to do, you're going to soon realize you made a mistake (like me). So think it through, and see if you can imagine yourself with a career in a life science field.","@wendy_wang0425 It's not that hard if you're really interested in it.","don‚Äôt do it ü§†","It's pretty manageable"],

Which as a whole make people harder to understand and divides the political world even more than it already is. Which is dangerous as fuck during our political climate because nothing is getting decided on while we're getting more and more heated for no reason at all.

You need to be honest with yourself and seek a positive environment. You can try speaking to a counselor to try and help you come to terms with your sexuality or try to do it yourself. But the point is that nothing good comes out of self hatred and it's only worsening your friends as it is now. Thus you have to face yourself at some point or it will overshadow everything about yourself in the new future. You can't hide from your feelings forever man.","@aadil_jaffer","@adarshaddepalli @angieluo üî•"],

Probably also depends on your own cultural views, cuz I could never even fathom not getting a degree.","Is the salary enough to survive off of? Is there potential to move up? I wouldn't quit school altogether, maybe just do Part-time studies and work fulltime","@ms_kasia_b is there job security?","I know someone who worked full time during the day and went to night school. If you are able/would like to do that, that might be something that could work","whats the job","Yeah if it pays well and u won't lose that job any time soon, then honest why do u go to school still? The whole point of uni is to get paid better, but if u get a job now, eventually cuz if experience you'll get higher pay hopefully.","Work turns out to be mcdicks","It depends on your field and life goals. If you want to make enough for you to survive and simply have that. Then that's fine. You don't need university experience for some jobs although it can be extremely difficult for you to cope with the cost of living as a result and might retreat your decision. However, if you want to achieve higher paying jobs and achieve a greater amount of security then you might be willing to suffer through the pain of university to obtain a higher wage and a better job. All in all it depends on what you want to do and who you want to be in life and another alternative would be just to transfer to college to get a similar degree but with a slower rate and course load. Don't entirely forsake education in your happiness because it has value that you cannot see due to your current state of thinking"],

If this were the case, kids wouldn‚Äôt be getting raped, but they do. You can‚Äôt blame the victim for how the predator‚Äôs mind wrongly works. Committing a crime and invading someone‚Äôs body is SO different from just perceiving how women are. I feel bad for whoever wrote this.","A woman could be fully naked walking the streets and still not deserve to be raped. No one deserves to get raped smh. This is disgusting. A man doesn‚Äôt have the right to touch a woman if she doesn‚Äôt want him too, literally men like that need help. And girls like u need to realize that women can be wearing a full on burqa and be raped, it ain‚Äôt about the clothes","‚ÄúWritten by a woman‚Äù seems legit","Hm, lets pretend I believed this. What would then confuse me is why women in countries where it‚Äôs the norm to cover your entire body still get raped and harassed? Now, being realistic and acknowledging that this is false, this argument doesn‚Äôt make sense. Men who go out and rape women are usually not suddenly overcome by lust after seeing a butt. They may have real, mental issues or a desire to exercise power, which means that the problem doesn‚Äôt end when women stop dressing like ‚Äúhookers‚Äù, as you say, but rather when would-be rapists get help.","bruh what lmao, you‚Äôre basically justifying rape against hookers and those that dress alike.","Hella nonsense","Rape is unjustifiable regardless and you pardoning it, even though you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre not by using the example of how men perceive it, is exactly what enforces rape culture and makes it ok for people to use underwear/revealing clothing as ‚Äúasking for it‚Äù","Let's not forget that many, if not most, case of rape/sexual assault, the rapist is somebody the victim know personally.","Instead of telling women what to and not to wear, maybe teach men how to respect a person‚Äôs body?","What do you say to people who get raped while wearing burqas? What a stupid post.","You‚Äôre comparing guns, which are designed to kill people, with underwear, which most certainly aren‚Äôt designed to encourage rape. FALSE EQUIVALENCE.","Fuck this ignorant post pt 3; but also, if everyone thought rape was wrong... there would be no rape... but there is. Rapists don‚Äôt rape clothes. Rapists rape people.","Imho rape has less to do with sexual attraction and more to do with aggression and power. Just my opinion.","Idk about all the anger in chat but the burka seems pretty effective ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.","@omar_hassan1535 no it isn‚Äôt? Maybe you‚Äôre deluded because it‚Äôs highly stigmatized to report rape in most Muslim countries. However, I do believe in dressing modestly, but that doesn‚Äôt stop rape, kids get raped, people get raped by relatives, young boys get raped. Gtfo","This is fucking personal. You are a fucking asshole and I hope that you get your head out of your fucking ass ASAP.","Also we get it you‚Äôre noT LikE oTheR gIrLs","I‚Äôm gonna pretend I just didn‚Äôt read the most ignorant post of 2018. ‚ÄúDress like hookers‚Äù, wtf does that have to do with rape???? Some men should Learn to keep their hands off women if there‚Äôs no consent.","@ayla_173 lol k, of course it happens but it can be reduced via the burka which removes any form of sexualization and portrays  strong religious piety. Try walking around in Afghanistan with less moderate wear. It isn‚Äôt justified that you can be attacked for it but it is likely to happen. Also, fuck you for being a pretentious cunt. I spent most of my life in the Middle-East campaigning for women‚Äôs rights, don‚Äôt assume I don‚Äôt know the dynamics over there. Twat","@omar_hassan1535 I have spent most of my life in a Muslim country too, and have experienced derogatory things while fully clothed, so your ‚Äúsexualization can be decreased by wearing the burka‚Äù argument doesn‚Äôt really hold up practically. And literally every single female I know can attest to that.","@omar_hassan1535 also, Not every country is a Muslim country, so portraying ‚Äústrong religious piety‚Äù isn‚Äôt gonna make you less likely to get raped. And I wonder what rights you‚Äôve been advocating for if you believe that the primary way to prevent rape is throwing on a piece of cloth.","@duncangreen96 truth‚Ñ¢","Dumbass alertt","@x_just_squigs_x idk what world you live in but clearly this dude must be delusional.  Btw if you have more guns in usa no one will dare to shoot üòè","@ayla_173 @ayla_173 ‚Äúyour argument is invalid because of my personal experience and mine alone, not taking into account other perspectives‚Äù. Nice. I never said fully clothed. I said Burka. And I bloody well didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the primary way to prevent it. I never even stated my opinion on whether a burka should be worn or not.

Students often times just want 1% that will make or break their mf gpa and y‚Äôall really out here acting like we asking to get bumped from a 47 to a 96.","Didn‚Äôt know asking for a 0.4% bump is so controversial üò™","@someonecalledphilippe Jeffrey I'm???","@findycang IIRC, Jeffery is a PhD student, so it could be him.","OP have you ever considered that the marks given are not a true reflection of knowledge of the materials from the course. What if someone was sick during a test but wrote it anyway, or had two assignments due on the same day? Obviously asking for a large bump is not going to happen but the littlest thing can affect your mark no matter how much you know and have studied. Just lowe da mandem","@rubyy.amin acting like they‚Äôve never asked for a bump in their grades too üò©","@jasmine.z85 no no i‚Äôm sure they tried and got that 96 all on their ones üò©üò©üëåüèº","RETWEET","@persaudiana time management is everything. 2 assignments in a day is doable. Also, if they're sick, doctors notes are always available.","preacH","@vlad_christian777","@doseofnik op? üòÇ okay those weren't the best example... a prof cant ask you questions about every single thing in the course, meaning there are things you know and will be tested but things you dont know and will be tested on, so is your final mark really the best reflection on how you learned and what you're taking away from the course? They're just how you performed on the chosen type of assessment... if you suck at MC and tests are purely MC rip... so asking for marks because the institution we attend requires that specific number is it really so terrible? Obvisouly 44 to 97 not possible but 62 to 63 could be the different between a single test question","@persaudiana I suppose it changes as you get through the years. I'm in fourth year and all my profs are really understanding so I'm looking at the situation differently. But I still think people should go with course expectations and work harder if they want better grades - that's what university is about! That said I can't speak for people who have personal issues that prevent them from achieving their full potential!","@persaudiana I just don't think it's the profs responsibility to bump marks to make a student happy. It undermines the integrity of our academic and prestigious institution.","@persaudiana but going back to OPs point, if it's an unreasonable grade, a request for appeal makes sense","Um but they do need it tho... I'd remark because that's your fucking job bitch. You get paid for it. So 20-30 emails shouldn't fucking make you spiral out of control like this TA*. Profs get it a lot worse lolz. But again they are also being paid to address our questions and concerns. Even if some student is being a petty bitch and grade grubbing for 1 pt. Extra. But it makes a diff from 70s to an 80 that one point. Then lolz sure as hell expect a student hitting you up and begging you to fix it* at least they aren't demanding it !","@doseofnik no one is paying for a doctor's note and outting the envitable to a later date. It don't matter. Unless you are reallt sick then you should get a note. Not fake a note just because you have too many assignments or tests in one day. In fact there is a petirion which costs $70 bucks. No one is fucking paying that. And there are some people who actually don't lie and just use the doctor note of illness excuse to get out shit that is aspected of them in the first place. üôÑ","@reb1z yeah no I feel you, it annoys me so much"],

Your diet is really important since you need a caloric deficit to lose weight. Eat less of foods that have a high amount of calories/sugar/fried food. Get a gym membership,  burn some calories and you'll lose water weight in the beginning. Exercising is one thing that saved me from a really dark place in my life that no one knows about because I was literally contemplating ways of suicide. No one would have expected me of all people to be silently suffering. Make new friends or talk to current friends about being workout buddies, friends make it so much easier. Try intermittent fasting, I've seen it work wonders for some people. And if nothing works,  there are surgical procedures that can chop off some of that belly. If you have any questions or doubts,  feel free to shoot me a DM. Trust me, I'm no expert, but I love to help people in need üß§","I plan on losing 120 pounds by August!

I‚Äôm a domestic student and the entire burden of tuition is on me. Regardless of how much you have to pay for tuition, the same problems arise. Living expenses and travel largely affect both groups of students. I think we‚Äôre all missing the point that this shouldn‚Äôt be an argument between the groups, but should be a collaborative effort to address the lack of financial support for both parties.","lmfao shut up","@heydaridaniel I‚Äôm GAGGING AHAHA","@ema23malik you can work full time during the summer? 40 hrs a week x $15 is over 2k per month..","@xxshannonbrown Minimum wage is $14 (thanks doug ford) but yeah ur point is still valid $14x8 hours a day 5 days a week for 2 months. Comes to $4480 and even after tax thats like one whole semester covered.","@le.notlee nah that math actually adds up considering you live at home and ur parents pay for expenses like food/phone/internet","Buddy I worked for the entire summer and at the end I could barely afford to buy a can of name brand mayo but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è *unimpressed trombone noises*","@saumya510 @not.your.piya @snehalbhattacharya @maitreyi_joshi @ani_9001","Most internationals ARE rich because guess what, folks can't cover any significant amount of international tuition by working, so parents have to pay.","Working the whole summer won‚Äôt get you much unless you‚Äôre an exotic dancer lmao","Trust me, if I thought I could put a dent in my tuition fees by getting a job, I'd be working 20 hours a week already. Working would barely cover my residence fees, not counting meals, if I worked for a full 8 months.","Obviously it's fucked up that some people have to work to pay tuition, but I think we can acknowledge that without omitting the fact that for international people, even that isn't an option.","can y'all relax we're all struggling students anyways and fighting the same fight why is this international vs. domestic when it should be students vs. high tuition chosen by the government like tf","You gotta be turning tricks 24/7 to make 8k in one summer üòÇ","@vijay.does.not.singh Not if your tuition is 16k","@le.notlee lmao ikr i work while study and make like  nothing and im drowning in workload and so fkking tired.

I get that food and rent are not expenses but we don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake‚Äù money from it.","@le.notlee and what im saying is if you work 8  hours a day on weekends alone thats $11,500 at minimum wage. You can work more days during the summer too and maybe even 4-8 hours during the school week. So 15k-20k a year is possible.
